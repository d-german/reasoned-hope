Defending the Faith

What is Apologetics

1 Pet 3:15

But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer
to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do
this with gentleness and respect. (NIV) [2 Cor 10:5; Jude 1:3-4; Acts 17:22-34]

● apologia
○
○

verbal defense, speech in defense
a reasoned statement or an argument

Acts 17:22–31

What tactics does Paul use in Acts 17:22–31 to persuade non-Jews that the
gospel is true?

'For in him we live and move and have our being.*' As some of your

Vs 28
own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.**'

 *Cretan poet Epimenides (c.600 B.C.)

 **Cilician poet Aratus (c. 315-240 B.C.)

The Purpose of Apologetics

● Shaping culture

○

If the gospel is to be heard as an intellectually viable option for thinking men and women
today, then it’s vital that we as Christians try to shape American culture in such a way that
Christian belief cannot be dismissed as mere superstition.
The Gospel is already foolish don't make it more foolish. (1 Corinthians 4:10)

○ Anthony, the arrogant atheist

● Knowing why you believe as well as what you believe will make you more

confident in sharing your faith with others.

● Help you keep the faith in times of doubt and struggle

○ Young adults aren't sticking with the church, 70% of surveyed Protestants stopped attending

by age 23.

○ More than half (52%) had religious, ethical or political reasons for quitting.

Knowing versus Showing that Christianity is true.

There are many things we believe, even though we can't ever prove them, e.g.,

● The world has existed more than five minutes.
● Laws of Logic. ( The law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle , and

the law of identity. )

● It is wrong to hurt other people for fun.
● The testimony of others

These things are called properly basic beliefs.

We have an extremely strong sense that these beliefs are true (even if we can't
prove them) and no reason to think that these beliefs are actually false.

Knowing versus Showing the Christianity is true.

If I become aware of some defeater of one of my properly basic beliefs, then I
should give it up (or find a defeater of the defeater).

● Oleg and the stars

We might not be absolutely certain they are true, but most people would still want
to say we're justified or rational in thinking that they are true.

We know that some beliefs are not true.

● There is no such thing as Truth (self-defeating)
● All religions or beliefs are true (Violate law non-contradiction)
● The Flying Spaghetti Monster (incoherent)
● I just believe in one less god than you. (Logical fallacy)

Knowing versus Showing the Christianity is true.

Sometimes we even know that we should keep believing something is true even if
there is much evidence against it.

● The story of the guy who knows he's innocent

Knowing versus Showing the Christianity is true.

● John 14:16-17, 20 - Jesus says the Holy Spirit is with us and gives us

assurance that Jesus lives in us and we in him.

● Romans 8:15-16 - Paul says we have confidence that we are God's children

because his Spirit is in us.

● 1 John 4:13, 5:6-10 - John says that we have confident knowledge that God
lives in us because of the Witness of the Holy Spirit (which is even greater
than that of men).

● So according to the Bible, we know that Christianity is true because the Holy

Spirit lives in us and gives us this Knowledge.

● So, how do I know Christianity is true?
● You know it's true because the Holy Spirit Witnesses in your heart.

Knowing versus Showing the Christianity is true.

We have already seen that we have many properly basic beliefs. So why can't
beliefs like "God exists" or "Jesus loves me" also be properly basic?

Belief in God is properly basic. Man has an innate, natural capacity to
apprehend God's existence even as he has a natural capacity to accept truths
of perception (like "I see a tree"). Given the appropriate circumstances—such
as moments of guilt, gratitude, or a sense of God's handiwork in nature-man
naturally apprehends God's existence. In the same way that certain
perceptual beliefs, like "I see a tree," are properly basic given the appropriate
circumstances, so belief in God is properly basic in appropriate
circumstances.

Knowing versus Showing the Christianity is true.

You don't actually need arguments or evidences at all.

The witness of the Holy Spirit is stronger than any argument.

Most Christians aren't able to study the arguments. So it seems crazy that you

can only become a Christian after studying the arguments for years and years!

There is a better way of Knowing Christianity is true - The Holy Spirit

Showing that Christianity is true.

● We can know it’s true how do we show thats it true?
● You show it's true to other people by sharing the arguments and evidence.
● The arguments can

○ Strengthen your Christian faith, especially when times are bad.
○ Help you share the faith more bravely.
○ Be used by the Holy Spirit to help unbelievers come to faith
○ Help show unbelievers like Muslims that the beliefs they think are

properly basic for them (e.g., that Islam is true, etc.) are actually false.

Showing that Christianity is true.

● All you need to do is show that the arguments' are more likely true than false.
● Remember, it's hard to be absolutely certain about many things. Of course,

other people will also try to give arguments that you are wrong!
● But we can trust that the Witness of the Holy Spirit is always greater.
● Our arguments are better than theirs!

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

● Arguments for a position does not mean quarreling about it.
● An argument is a set of statements that serve as premises leading to a

conclusion.

● Rules of argumentation apply to all reasoning everywhere, no matter what the

subject. We use these rules unconsciously every day in normal life.

● For example: Suppose a friend says to you, “I’ve got to go to the library today
to check out a book.” And you reply, “You can’t do that today.” “Why not?” he
asks. “Because today is Sunday,” you explain, “and the library isn’t open on
Sunday.”

○

In effect, you have just presented an argument to your friend.

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

If today is Sunday, the library is closed.

1.
2. Today is Sunday.
3. Therefore, the library is closed.

● This is what we call a logically valid argument. That is to say, if steps 1 and 2 are

true, then the conclusion, 3, is also true.

● Steps 1 and 2 in this argument are called premises. If you obey the rules of logic

and your premises are true, then your conclusion must be true as well.

● It is not just your opinion that the library is closed; you have given an argument for

that conclusion.

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

1. All men are mortal.
2. Socrates is a man.
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

A good argument has premises that are collectively more plausible than their
contradictories (or denials). It is not required that we have 100 percent certainty of the
truth of the premises. If collectively the premises are more plausible than not, then the
conclusion of a deductive argument is guaranteed to be more plausible than not.

Socrates could have been just a mythological figure.

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

Bad Argument Example - Not logically valid

If Sherrie gets an A in Mathematics, she’ll be proud of her work.

1.
2. Sherrie is proud of her work.
3. Therefore, Sherrie got an A in Mathematics.

All three of these statements may in fact be true. But because (3) does not follow
logically from (1) and (2), this is an invalid argument. From the knowledge of (1)
and (2), you cannot know that (3) is also true. The above is therefore not a good
argument.

Sherrie could still be proud if she got a B instead.

●

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

Bad Argument Example - Logical fallacies

If the Bible is God’s Word, then it is God’s Word.

1.
2. The Bible is God’s Word.
3. Therefore, the Bible is God’s Word.

This is a logically valid argument, but it assumes what it sets out to prove and
therefore proves nothing new. A good argument will not only follow the rules of
logic but will also avoid logical fallacies.

● This is a Circular Argument.
● https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/

Arguments and Evidence Deductive* Arguments

Bad Argument Example - False premises

1. Anything with webbed feet is a bird.
2. A platypus has webbed feet.
3. Therefore, a platypus is a bird.

This is a valid argument, but premise (1) is false. There are animals other than
birds that have webbed feet.

An argument that is both logically valid and has true premises is called a sound
argument. An unsound argument is either invalid or else has a false premise.

1. Groups A, B, and C were composed of similar persons suffering from the

same disease.

2. Group A was administered a certain new drug, group B was administered a

placebo, and group C was not given any treatment.

3. The rate of death from the disease was subsequently lower in group A by 75

percent in comparison with both groups B and C.

4. Therefore, the new drug is effective in reducing the death rate from said

disease

The conclusion is quite likely true based on the evidence and rules of inductive
reasoning.

pennies.

● Every time you eat peanuts, your throat swells up and you can’t breathe. This

Arguments and Evidence Inductive Arguments

● Inference to the best explanation.

○ When we are confronted with certain data to be explained
○ We assemble a pool of live options consisting of various explanations for

the data in question.

○ From the pool of live options we then select the explanation that, if true,

best explains the data.

Arguments and Evidence Inductive Arguments

● Inference to the best explanation.

○ Just what criteria go toward making an explanation the best is disputed;
but among the commonly acknowledged criteria will be properties such
as the following:

Arguments and Evidence Inductive Arguments

1. Explanatory scope. The best hypothesis will explain a wider range of data than will rival

hypotheses.

2. Explanatory power. The best hypothesis will make the observable data more epistemically

probable than rival hypotheses.

3. Plausibility. The best hypothesis will be implied by a greater variety of accepted truths and

its negation implied by fewer accepted truths than rival hypotheses.

4. Less ad hoc. The best hypothesis will involve fewer new suppositions not already implied by

existing knowledge than rival hypotheses.

5. Accord with accepted beliefs. The best hypothesis, when conjoined with accepted truths,

will imply fewer falsehoods than rival hypotheses.

6. Comparative superiority. The best hypothesis will so exceed its rivals in meeting conditions

(1) through (5) that there is little chance of a rival hypothesis’s exceeding it in fulfilling those
conditions.

Arguments and Evidence Inductive Arguments

Neo-Darwinian theory of biological evolution and Intelligent Intelligent Design are
good examples of inference to the best explanation.

Darwinists adhere to naturalism and simply rule out ID as a viable option.

ID is quite OK to agree that the neo-Darwinian synthesis is the best naturalistic
explanation available but what is important is not that it is the best naturalistic
explanation, but whether it is the best overall explanation.

ID argues that once explanations involving intelligent design are allowed into the
pool of live options, then the superiority of the neo-Darwinian theory is no longer
apparent.

Arguments and Evidence Inductive Arguments

● Accusing someone of using a God of the Gaps argument
○ Example of Ad Hominem and Strawman fallacy.
○ Cuts both ways

■ Evolution, Scientism of the Gaps
■ ID uses an inductive argument
■ Our repeated and uniform experience.

digital code or functional information is intelligence.

God And Evidence

God And Evidence

If the non-theist says, "I don't believe in God", and you ask "why?", he might say -

1. There isn't enough evidence.

2. I think I can prove God doesn't exist.

3. "I don't care, and I don't wanna talk about it, so leave me alone!"

It's very difficult to be a hard agnostic. Just ask the hard agnostic - How do you
know?

God And Evidence

It's easy to prove that some things don't exist, e.g.,

● A square circle
● Freezing Fire
● Someone who is exactly both 10 and 20 years old

It's quite hard to prove God doesn't exist - since the idea of God isn't "nonsense"
like the above examples.

God And Evidence

When these people say "There's not enough evidence," what they usually mean is
that there is not enough evidence to force them to believe.

But there IS evidence - the many arguments for God!

● Cosmological
●  Kalam
●  Moral

● Design
● Ontological
● Resurrection of Jesus

So, agnostics and atheists will have to show these evidences are no good.

God And Evidence

BUT- even if the evidence is NOT good enough, can you be an atheist?

Is absence of evidence,  evidence of absence?

God And Evidence

What's the difference? It's not just because the elephant is bigger than the ant.

● What if you're in a zoo standing outside a big locked room? Now is it true that
"I don't see an elephant in the room" .. there is no elephant? Not necessarily

The difference here is because -

● If there were an elephant here in the room, you would expect to see it.
● But if there were an ant in the room, you wouldn't necessarily expect to see it.

God And Evidence

Thus the absence of evidence is evidence of absence only in cases in which, were
the postulated entity to exist, we should expect to have some evidence of its
existence.

So what about God? If God existed, should we expect to have more evidence of
his existence than what we DO have? Not necessarily. Why not?

God And Evidence

1. Does God ONLY care if we believe he exists?
2. Do you think he would want to do "magic tricks" just to entertain us? No
3. The Bible says that God wants to be like our father- he wants us to love him,

as he loves us.
4. Look at James 2:19.
5. Remember the story of Moses and the Israelites
6.

If we only believe God exists, it's not enough - we will say, "OK, he exists," but
we might not even care - we might just keep going on our way!

7. God doesn't want to force us to believe in him. He wants us to love him freely.
8.

If God made himself completely obvious to us (e.g., writing his name on the
sky), it might not work. We may even begin to hate him because of it!

God And Evidence

● We have very good evidence for God's existence (the many arguments for

God)!

● But the Bible says we are sinful, self-centered people. Many times we don't

want to believe in God and don't want to obey his rules.

● So, even if you show the atheist good evidence for God, it might be hard for

him to believe in God.

Story of the pharmacists who didn't want to believe.

God And Evidence

Fairies and Santa Claus?

● If fairies or other small people exist, we should expect to find

○ little villages
○ little bits of poo, etc .
○ Small bones

● If Santa exists, we should expect to find

○ Factories at the north pole
○ Flying reindeer
○ Presents all over the world that weren't given by people we know, etc

God And Evidence

Teapots far out in space?

● There's no evidence teapots DO exist out in space - but does this mean we

should only say "we don't know' if there's a teapot out there? No, because . ..

● We can show that a teapot far out in space probably doesn't exist. Why?
● Because we're quite sure that the only way it could've gotten there is if

astronauts put it there. But we know that astronauts haven't gone that far out
in space, and anyway we're pretty sure that they wouldn't do silly things like
put teapots in space!

God And Evidence

Floating pink elephants that are invisible and immaterial (not made of stuff)?

● These things don't leave evidence. So can we only say we don't know if they

exist?

● The problem is, an "invisible, immaterial, floating elephant" seems to be

nonsense.

○ An elephant has to be material and have weight and a size, or it wouldn't be an elephant

anymore

● But what about just invisible, immaterial things? Maybe now we should say, "I

don't know."

○ Because we have no evidence against invisible, immaterial things.
○ Because immaterial things like angels or spirits seem possible.(Abstract objects)

God And Evidence

● Thoughtful atheists do try to provide arguments against God’s existence.
● The two main ones we will cover are:

○ The Hiddenness of God
○ The Problem of Evil or Suffering

● For thousands of years these two represent the best that the atheist has to

offer.

God And Evidence

Be careful with arguments from probability, psychology etc.

If God exists, then he would do X, Y, and Z.

1.
2. But he doesn’t do X, Y, and Z.
3. Therefore God does not exist.

For example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_intercessory_prayer

The Hiddenness of God

● If God existed then he'd opt for more to believe, for relationship sake.
● Any loving God who exists would've chosen to ensure less (or no) disbelief

occur.

● This is relevant because there are so many today and throughout history who
have inculpably remained in non-belief, persons who have obviously not had
any God convincingly meet them or otherwise bring them to belief.

The Hiddenness of God

If God exists (a greatest possible being), then God is all-good.
If God is all-good, then God is perfectly loving.

1.
2.
3. So if God exists, then God is perfectly loving.
4. But a perfectly loving God would ensure everyone is always able to be in relationship

with God just by trying.

5. And that ability requires belief that God exists.
6. So, if God exists, then God would ensure all believe.
7. So, if God exists, all persons believe God exists.
8. But not everyone believes that.
9. So no God has ensured everyone believes it.

10. So no God has ensured everyone is able to be in such relationship just by trying.
11. So no perfectly loving God exists.
12. So no all-good God exists.
13. So God does not exist.

The Hiddenness of God

Are premises (4)-(6) true? Are there any kinds of individuals who a perfectly loving
God might choose to allow to be in non-belief, temporarily or permanently?

● Some would just immediately reject relationship

○ Some resistant non-theists, upon coming to belief, would immediately
reject loving relationship. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misotheism

“Even if Jesus did exist, even if I agreed …, yep, he rose from the dead, yep, there’s a God, yep, I
don’t deny any of that, does not mean that he is my Lord. If he did exist…I will go happily to hell. It
would be worse of a hell for me to bow down before a Lord…regardless of the legend and historicity
issue…Even if I agreed 100%, I would still reject that Being as a Lord of my life because I’m better
than that…I cannot accept Jesus as Lord…You’re much more free to live and enjoy your life
unshackled from the demands…” Dan Barker (Founder of Freedom from Religion foundation)

The Hiddenness of God

● Some non-theists would just form a perpetually improper relationship with

God. This is relevant because such an improper relationship could be such
that it is better for it to have never existed.

○ Does not recognize God as Good

○

■

Individuals, upon entering into relationship with God, would unacceptably struggle with
bitterness/resentment towards God, feeling things should be done differently.

○

Judges god for allowing suffering

■ Appropriate relationship with God trusts God's decisions in allowing suffering (perhaps

for greater goods).

The Hiddenness of God

● Some non-theists, if they became theists, would enter proper relationship with
God but then abandon it later in life. [I thinks this is possible but I don’t believe
it is so]

● One could imagine a number of scenarios where a greater number of persons
enter into relationship because God remains hidden to some non-believers.

○

“If God were to inscribe His name on every atom or place a neon cross in the sky, people
might believe that He exists; but what confidence could we have that after time they would not
begin to chafe under the brazen advertisements of their Creator and even come to resent such
effrontery? In fact, we have no way of knowing that in a world of free creatures in which God’s
existence is as obvious as the nose on your face that more people would come to love Him
and know His salvation than in the actual world.” [William Craig & J.P. Moreland, Philosophical
Foundations for a Christian Worldview (IVP, 2004), 157]

The Hiddenness of God

● It will be more merciful for those who don't believe than those who do but

"The servant who knows the master's will and does not get ready or does not do what the

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

● Thoughtful atheists do try to provide arguments against God’s existence.

Undoubtedly, the most important of these is the problem of Evil or suffering.

● Versions of the Problem of Suffering

○

■ Concerns whether it’s plausible to think that God and suffering can coexist.

○ Emotional

■ Concerns people’s dislike of a God who would permit suffering.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering

● Now in discussing the intellectual problem of suffering, it’s important that we

keep in mind who has the burden of proof here.

● The atheist is the one making the claim
● So now it’s the atheist who must shoulder the burden of proof. It’s up to him to
give us an argument leading to the conclusion “Therefore, God does not
exist.”

● Don’t allow the atheist to shirk his intellectual responsibilities. He’s the one
who claims that the coexistence of God and suffering is impossible or
improbable. So it’s up to him to give us his argument and to support his
premises.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering

● Logical Version: “It’s Logically Impossible for God and Suffering to Coexist.”

○ According to the logical version of the problem it’s logically impossible for God and suffering to

both exist. I.e. married bachelor or square circle

1.

2.
3.

If an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent god exists, then
evil and suffering does not.
There is evil and suffering in the world.
Therefore, an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent god does
not exist.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Logical Version

● There seem to be two hidden assumptions made by the atheist. They are:

○
○

If God is all-powerful, He can create any world that He wants.
If God is all-loving, He prefers a world without evil and suffering.

● The argument here is that God is all-loving and all-powerful. Therefore, He

both can and wants to create a world without evil and suffering. Therefore, it
follows that the world has no evil or suffering. But that contradicts 2, Suffering
exists. Therefore, God must not exist.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Logical Version

● If God is all-powerful, He can create any world that He wants.
● Is that necessarily true?
● Not if it’s possible that people have free will! It’s logically impossible to make
someone do something freely. That is as logically impossible as making a
round square or a married bachelor.

○

If the unbeliever insists that an all-powerful being can do the logically impossible, then the
problem of suffering evaporates immediately, for then God can bring it about that He and
suffering both exist, even though this is logically impossible!

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Logical Version

● If God is all-loving, He prefers a world without suffering?
● Is that necessarily true?
● It doesn’t seem like it. For God could have overriding reasons for allowing the
suffering in the world. We all know cases in which we permit suffering in order
to bring about a greater good (like taking our child to the dentist).

● The atheist, has taken on a burden of proof so heavy that it’s unsustainable.

He would have to show that free will is impossible and that it’s impossible that
a world with suffering would be better than a world without suffering.

Intellectual Problem of Suffering

● Evidential Version: “It’s Improbable That God Could Have Good Reasons for

Permitting Suffering.”

○

The evidential version of the problem of evil (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive
version), seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the
existence of God, counts against or lowers the probability of the truth of theism.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Evidential Version

Response

1. Human Limitations

a.

First, we’re not in a position to say that it’s improbable that God lacks good reasons for
permitting the suffering in the world.

b. As finite persons, we’re limited in space and time, in intelligence and insight. But God sees the
end of history from its beginning and providentially orders history to His ends through people’s
free decisions and actions. In order to achieve His purposes God may have to allow a great
deal of suffering along the way. Suffering that appears pointless within our limited framework
may be seen to have been justly permitted by God within His wider framework.

Response

1. Human Limitations example:

Chaos theory: certain large-scale systems, for example, the weather or insect
populations, are extraordinarily sensitive to the smallest disturbances. A butterfly
fluttering on a twig in West Africa may set in motion forces that will eventually
issue in a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean. Yet it’s impossible for anyone
observing that butterfly fluttering on that branch to predict such an outcome.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Evidential Version

Response

1. Human Limitations
● This is not to appeal to mystery but rather to point to our inherent limitations,
which make it impossible for us to say, when confronted with some example
of suffering, that God probably has no good reason for permitting it to occur.
● Unbelievers themselves recognize these limitations in other contexts. One
objection to utilitarianism is that we have no idea of the ultimate outcome of
our actions.

● Thoughts about Eugenics, Holocaust, State of Israel

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Evidential Version

Response

● The Full Scope of the Evidence (Only would work if 50/50 chance God exist)

○ Relative to the full scope of the evidence, God’s existence is probable.
○ Probabilities are always relative to some background information. What is

the background information? Only the suffering in the world? The
question is whether God’s existence is probable relative to the full scope
of the evidence. Whatever improbability suffering may cast upon God’s
existence, it’s outweighed by the arguments for the existence of God.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

Intellectual Problem of Suffering: Evidential Version

Response

● Christianity entails doctrines that increase the probability of the coexistence of

God and suffering.
1. The chief purpose of life is not happiness, but the knowledge of God.
2. Mankind is in a state of rebellion against God and His purpose.
3. God’s purpose is not restricted to this life but spills over beyond the grave

into eternal life.

4. The knowledge of God in glory is an incommensurable good.

● After ... great endurance, troubles, hardships, distresses, beatings,

imprisonments, riots; hard work, sleepless nights and hunger … 2 Cor 6:4-5

● Paul says:
● Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet
inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary
troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So
we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is
seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. 2 Cor 4:16-18

...that non-human animals do not have a first-person perspective on their experiences, including experiences of pain, that is
to say, they cannot adjoin to their experiences the prefix “I think/feel that. . . ,”so that animals, even if in pain, are not aware
that they are themselves in pain. Wholly independently of this point, Dr. Murray shows that his critics have not shown that
animal suffering of a morally significant sort really exists.

For many people, the problem of evil is not really an intellectual problem: it is an emotional
problem. They are hurting inside and perhaps bitter against a God who would permit them or
others to suffer so. Never mind that there are philosophical solutions to the problem of
evil—they do not care and simply reject a God who allows such suffering as we find in the
world.

○ What can be said to those who are laboring under the emotional problem of evil? In one

sense, the most important thing may not be what one says at all. The most important thing
may be just to be there as a loving friend and sympathetic listener. But some people may need
counsel, and we ourselves may need to deal with this problem when we suffer.

The Problem of Evil (Suffering)

● Emotional Problem of Suffering

○ Does Christian theism also have the resources to deal with this problem

○

as well?
As the Christian sees things, God does not stand idly by, coolly observing the suffering of his creatures. He
enters into and shares our suffering. He endures the anguish of seeing his son, the second person of the
Trinity, consigned to the bitterly cruel and shameful death of the cross. Some theologians claim that God
cannot suffer. I believe they are wrong. God’s capacity for suffering, I believe, is proportional to his greatness;
it exceeds our capacity for suffering in the same measure as his capacity for knowledge exceeds ours. Christ
was prepared to endure the agonies of hell itself; and God, the Lord of the universe, was prepared to endure
the suffering consequent upon his son’s humiliation and death. He was prepared to accept this suffering in
order to overcome sin, and death, and the evils that afflict our world, and to confer on us a life more glorious
that we can imagine. So we don’t know why God permits evil; we do know, however, that he was prepared to
suffer on our behalf, to accept suffering of which we can form no conception.

The Hiddenness of God

If God existed, then God would make His existence more obvious.

1.
2. God is not obvious.
3. Thus, God does not exist.

If God exists, then he would do X, Y, and Z.

1.
2. But he doesn’t do X, Y, and Z.
3. Therefore God does not exist.

The Hiddenness of God

The problem with the argument is that it assumes we can know exactly what it’s
like to be God; and more specifically what it’s like to reason as God. But to think
with omniscience and act with omnipotence as the eternal Creator is outside of our
limited human experience (imagine an ant trying to understand quantum
mechanics)

The Hiddenness of God

In fact, we have no way of knowing that in a world of free creatures in which God’s
existence is as obvious as the nose on your face that more people would come to
love him and know his salvation than in the actual world. But then the claim that if
God existed he would make his existence more evident has little or no warrant,
thereby undermining the claim that the absence of such evidence is itself positive
evidence that God does not exist.

The Cosmological Argument

● The universe is all of matter, energy, space, and time. It includes all the stars,

planets, mountains, trees, people, animals, dust, radiation, etc.

● A cause is something that makes something else happen.

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.
4. And this cause is beginningless, uncaused,
timeless, spaceless, immaterial, enormously
powerful and personal.

The Cosmological Argument

Is premise 1 true (or is it more likely true than false)?

● Isn't this completely obvious?
● If you hear a loud bang, wouldn't you ask what caused that bang?
● If a tiger suddenly began to exist in front of you and started chasing you, wouldn't

you want to know how the tiger got here?
● Something had to cause it to exist, right?
● Would you really believe that the tiger just appeared there for no reason at all.
● That's worse than magic:

○ In a magic show, when the magician pulls the rabbit out of the hat, at least

you got the magician and the hat.

The Cosmological Argument

Is premise 2 true?

● The universe began to exist because time had to have a beginning.
● Because before today came, the day before had to come. But the day before that

had to come. But the day before that had to come ....
○ If you keep doing this forever (without stopping at a beginning), how can you

get to today?! Think about an example of borrowing money forever.
● Also scientists who study the universe (called astronomers) agree. They say the

universe is expanding.
○ So if you go back in time, the universe would get smaller and smaller until

there was no universe at all. So the universe began to exist.

 Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem

Vilenkin is blunt about the implications:

It is said that an argument is what convinces reasonable men and a proof is what it takes to convince

even an unreasonable man. With the proof now in place, cosmologists can no longer hide behind the

possibility of a past-eternal universe. There is no escape, they have to face the problem of a cosmic

beginning (Many Worlds in One [New York: Hill and Wang, 2006], p.176).

 Second law of thermodynamics

If the universe will expand forever, then its death will be cold, as the galaxies turn their gas into stars, and the stars burn out. At

10^30 years the universe will consist of 90% dead stars, 9% supermassive black holes formed by the collapse of galaxies, and

1% atomic matter, mainly hydrogen. Elementary particle physics suggests that after 10^?? years protons will decay into electrons

and positrons so that space will be filled with a rarefied gas so thin that the distance between an electron and a positron will be

about the size of the present galaxy. After 10^?? Years, all black holes will completely evaporate and all the matter in the

ever-expanding universe will be reduced to a thin gas of elementary particles and radiation. Equilibrium will prevail throughout,

and the entire universe will be in its final state, from which no change will occur.

Now the question that needs to be asked is this: if given enough time the universe will reach heat death, then why is it not in a

state of heat death now, if it has existed forever, from eternity? If the universe did not begin to exist, then it should now be in a

state of equilibrium.

The Kalam Argument

The Design Argument

● Let's pretend we walked into a room, and we saw a huge house of cards standing

on a table!
○ For this house of cards to stand, the cards all have to fit together in just the

right Way!

○ We can see that if you moved any card by even a very tiny bit, the house

would fall!

● Question: "How did these cards all get together to form the house?" How did it

Happen?
○ There are only 3 answers:

■ It had to happen. (Physical Necessity)
■ It was just an accident.
■ Someone designed or made this house to fit together.

The Design Argument

● "It had to happen."

○ Did the cards have to fit together this way? No - each card could have been in

a different position, right?

○ There are many different ways the cards could have been arranged - they

didn't have to fit together to make a standing house of cards, right?

○ The cards could have just been lying messily on the table, or stacked in a

deck, etc.

● So is this a good answer? No

The Design Argument

● "It was just an accident."

○ What if I said, "Something tossed all those cards on the table, and the house

of cards just formed by accident." Would you believe me?
■ All the cards just happen to fit together in just the right pattern to make

this house??

■ There might be other ways to build a house of cards, but they all have to

fit just right, too.

The Design Argument

● What if I said, "No, it really was an accident! Someone was tossing those cards for
years and years, and luckily a house of cards did get formed today!" Would you
believe me? NO!
○ Even if the cards were tossed for years, it is overwhelmingly improbable a

house would be formed!

○ It is highly probable that every toss would have produced a mess.

● We have no reason to think the cards were tossed many times by something!
● So is this a good answer? No

The Design Argument

● Scientists have discovered many laws of nature.
● These laws describe what the universe is like, and how matter in the universe

behaves.

● We can write these laws as  equations, e.g. the force of gravity

The Design Argument

The Design Argument

● Scientists have found that in order for life to exist in the universe, these numbers

have to all fit together in just the right way - Just like a house of cards!
○ If they were different by even a teensy-weensy bit (compared to what they

could be), you couldn't have ANY life at all! This means the universe is very
special.
■ Their accuracy is extremely precise, MUCH more precise than what you

need to build a house of cards!

● Eg., stars wouldn't even exist, or all matter would just be made of one element,

etc.

The Design Argument

1. The fine-tuning of the universe is due to either physical necessity, chance or

design.
It is not due to physical necessity or chance.

2.
3. Therefore, it is due to design.

The number of seconds in the entire history of the universe is around 10^17 (that’s 1
followed by seventeen zeroes: 100,000,000,000,000,000). The number of subatomic
particles in the entire known universe is said to be around 10^80 (1 followed by eighty
zeroes). Such numbers are so huge that they’re simply incomprehensible.

The Design Argument

Examples of Fine-Tuning

● The so-called weak force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, governs

radioactive decay, which operates inside the nucleus of an atom, is so finely tuned
that an alteration in its value by even one part out of 10^100 would have
prevented a life-permitting universe!

● If we increased the strength of gravity by just 1 part in 10^34 of the range of force
strengths (the equivalent of moving less than one inch on the universe-long ruler),
the universe couldn’t have life sustaining planets.

● A change in the value of the so-called cosmological constant, which drives the

acceleration of the universe’s expansion, by as little as one part in 10^120 would
have rendered the universe life-prohibiting.

The Design Argument

Examples of Fine-Tuning

● The low-entropy state in which the universe began? Roger Penrose of Oxford
University has calculated that the odds of that low-entropy state’s existing by
chance alone is on the order of one chance out of 10^10 (123)

The Moral Argument

● Most of us don't think it's OK to hurt people for fun. But why not?

○ Just because we don't want them to hurt us?

■ But if I were really powerful, I wouldn't worry about other people's hurting

me! So, would it now be OK to hurt people for fun? No!

○ Just because we are smart (and not like other animals)?

■ But we can imagine very smart aliens who like killing humans for fun.

Would it be OK for them to do that? No!

● Anyway, many smart people have hurt other people for fun before.
● We don't hurt people for fun because we know it's wrong - that's why!
● Is it right that parents love their children? Yes

The Moral Argument

● So do we know that some things really are right or wrong? Yes.
● Here, when we say that something is right, it is also good. If something is wrong,

it is also bad.

● If we do the right thing, it just means that we do what we should do. If we do the

wrong thing, it just means that we do what we should not do.

The Moral Argument

● What if someone said, "Actually, nothing is really right or wrong!"

○ Most people actually do know deep inside that some things ARE right or

wrong, especially when other people are mean to them!
■ For example, the Story of the Blue Folder.
● Even if someone really believes that nothing is right or wrong.

○ He's like a blind man who believes there's no such thing as physical objects.
○ It won't stop us from knowing that physical objects ARE real or that some

things really ARE right or wrong.

The Moral Argument

● Moral value refers to the worth of a person or action, whether it is good or bad.
● Moral duty refers to our obligation to act in a certain way, whether that action is

right or wrong.
○ For example, it would be good for you to become a doctor, but you’re not

morally obligated to become a doctor.

● Objective moral values are right or wrong independent of whether anybody

believes it to be so.
○ For example, Nazi anti-Semitism was morally wrong, even though the Nazis
who carried out the Holocaust thought that it was good, and it would still be
wrong even if the Nazis had won World War II and succeeded in
exterminating or brainwashing everybody who disagreed with them.

The Moral Argument Premise 1

● If God does not exist, then what is the foundation for moral values?
● What is the basis for the value of human beings?
● If God does not exist, then it is difficult to see any reason to think that human

beings are special or that their morality is objectively valid.

● Why think that we have any moral obligations to do anything? Who or what

imposes any moral duties upon us?

● The most popular form of atheism is naturalism, which holds that the only things
that exist are the things described by our best scientific theories. But science is
morally neutral; you can’t find moral values in a test tube. It follows immediately
that moral values don’t really exist; they’re just illusions of human beings.

The Moral Argument Premise 1

On the atheistic view, human beings are just animals, and animals have no moral
obligations to one another. When a lion kills a zebra, it kills the zebra, but it does not
murder the zebra. When a great white shark forcibly copulates with a female, it forcibly
copulates with her but it does not rape her—for there is no moral dimension to these
actions. They are neither prohibited nor obligatory.

Crudely put, on the atheistic view human beings are just animals, and animals are not
moral agents.

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Atheistic moral realism

Atheistic moral realists affirm that objective moral values and
duties do exist and are not dependent on evolution or human
opinion, but they also insist that they are not grounded in God.
Indeed, moral values have no further foundation. They just exist.

Brute facts. (It is what it is.)

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Atheistic moral realism

● What does it mean to say, for example, that the moral value

justice just exists?
○ Atheistic moral realists seem to lack any adequate

foundation in reality for moral values but just leave them
floating in an unintelligible way.

○ Are there logical arguments for the existence of moral

values?

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Atheistic moral realism

● Second, this view provides no basis for moral duties.

○ Let us suppose for the sake of argument that moral values

like mercy, justice, love, forbearance and the like just
exist. (Brute Fact)
■ How does that result in any moral obligations for me?
Why would I have a moral duty to be, say, merciful?
Who or what lays such an obligation on me?

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Atheistic moral realism

● Third, it’s fantastically improbable that the blind evolutionary process should spit
forth precisely that sort of creatures who correspond to the abstractly existing
realm of moral values. This seems to be an utterly incredible coincidence. It’s
almost as if the moral realm knew that we were coming.

● Some atheists believe that moral values and duties are just

natural facts like 2 + 2 = 4
○ Can moral facts be reduced down to natural facts?

■ The natural fact that I will run over a dog If I don’t step
on my breaks gives me the reason to step on my

● Moral facts are considerations that count in favor of or give us
reasons to have certain beliefs or perform certain actions or
have certain desires

The Moral Argument Premise 1

● Even if there were abstract or concrete objective moral values

there is no moral accountability. If life ends at the grave, it
makes no difference whether one lives as a Stalin or as a

Humanism: Whatever Contributes to Human Flourishing Is Good

● Whatever contributes to human flourishing is good, and

whatever detracts from it is bad, and that’s the end of the
story. Brute fact.

Humanism is the view that man is the measure of all things. In particular, man takes the place of God as the
anchor of moral values, and moral duties are determined by what promotes human flourishing.

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Humanism: Whatever Contributes to Human Flourishing Is Good

● First, its arbitrariness.

○ Given atheism, why think that what is conducive to human
flourishing is any more valuable than what is conducive to
the flourishing of ants or mice? Why think that inflicting
harm on another member of our species is wrong?

The Moral Argument Premise 1

Humanism: Whatever Contributes to Human Flourishing Is Good

● Second, it's implausibility. (same as atheistic moral realism)
○ Some atheists  think that moral properties like goodness

and badness attach to certain things.
■ goodness attaches to a mother’s nursing her infant.
○ Some sort of explanation or logical argument is needed
for why or how moral properties would attach to things.

The Moral Argument Premise 1

The Euthyphro Dilemma

1.

Is something good because God wills it? Then the good is
arbitrary.

2. Does God will something because it is good? Then it is a

moral value independent of God.

God’s own holy and perfectly good nature supplies the absolute standard against
which all actions and decisions are measured. He is the locus and source of moral
value. He is by nature loving, generous, just, faithful, kind and so forth. (Brute fact)

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Objective moral values and duties exist.

Moral Experience

● The belief that some things are objectively good or evil, right

or wrong is a properly basic belief.

● The question, then, is: Do we have any overriding reason to
distrust our moral experience? Or are there any defeaters?

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Sociobiological Objections to Moral Experience

According to the sociobiological account, our moral beliefs have been
ingrained into us by evolution and social conditioning. Hence we can’t
have any confidence in them because evolution aims, not at truth, but at
survival. Our moral beliefs will be selected for their survival value, not for
their truth. So we can’t trust our moral experience and therefore don’t
know if premise 2 is true.

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Sociobiological Objections to Moral Experience

If there is no God, then human beings are just accidental by-products of
nature that have evolved relatively recently on an infinitesimal speck of dust
lost somewhere in a hostile and mindless universe and which are doomed to
perish individually and collectively in a relatively short time. Some action, say,
rape, may not be socially advantageous and so in the course of human
evolution has become taboo; but on the atheistic view it is difficult to see why
there is anything really wrong about raping someone.

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Michael Ruse writes,

The position of the modern evolutionist . . . is that humans have an awareness of
morality . . . because such an awareness is of biological worth. Morality is a
biological adaptation no less than are hands and feet and teeth. . . .Considered as
a rationally justifiable set of claims about an objective something, ethics is illusory.
I appreciate that when somebody says “Love thy neighbour as thyself,” they think
they are referring above and beyond themselves. . . . Nevertheless, . . . such
reference is truly without foundation. Morality is just an aid to survival and
reproduction, . . . and any deeper meaning is illusory.

Sociobiological Objections to Moral Experience

First it commits the Genetic Fallacy

● The Genetic Fallacy:

○ Attempts to invalidate a view by showing how a person came to believe
that view. For example, “The only reason you believe in democracy is
because you were raised in a democratic country. Therefore, your view
that democracy is the best form of government is false.” As an objection
to the truth of moral judgments, the sociobiological account is guilty of the
genetic fallacy.

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Sociobiological Objections to Moral Experience

Second, assumes atheism is true and the sociobiological
account at best only proves that our perception of moral
values has evolved. If moral values were discovered, not
invented, then our gradual and fallible apprehension of them
are no more undermined than our gradual, fallible perception
of the physical world.

The Moral Argument Premise 2

Sociobiological Objections to Moral Experience

● Third, the objection is self-defeating.

○ Assuming the truth of naturalism, all our beliefs, not
just our moral beliefs, are the result of evolution and
social conditioning.

○ But then we should be skeptical of the evolutionary

account itself, since it, too, is the product of evolution
and social conditioning!

single hair or thread

6. Every letter of every page and book was counted and compared against the original. The number of times
each letter of the alphabet occurred in a book was counted and compared against the original. The middle
letter of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) and the middle letter of the entire Hebrew
Bible were computed and indicated in the text. If one of these calculations was incorrect, the copy was
discarded.
The scribe could not write God’s name with a newly dipped pen (lest it blotch) and even if the king should
address him, while writing God’s name, he should take no notice of him.

The New Testament Documents

● Early Dating

○ Roman historian, Colin Hemer, reasons backwards from the Book of Acts to the three Synoptic

Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke). The book includes the martyrdom of Stephen (Acts
7:54-60) and James (Acts 12:1-2), but it says nothing of the deaths of Peter and Paul
(between A.D. 63-66). Acts also fails to include the accounts of the Jewish war with the
Romans (A.D. 66) and the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Acts abruptly ends with Paul’s
arrest in Rome, without any resolution to the situation.

○ Since Luke, the writer of Acts left out such important events as listed above, it is reasonable to
conclude that he wrote Acts before these events took place, around A.D. 62. Because Luke
was written before Acts, and Matthew and Mark likely before Luke, then the three Synoptic
Gospels were written at least before the mid-60s A.D.

● By contrast, the earliest writings about Alexander the Great come nearly 400

years after he died!

● The introduction to Luke is a long, carefully constructed sentence in the

tradition of the finest historical works in Greek literature. It was customary
among the great Greek and Hellenistic historians,to explain and justify their
work in a preface. Their object was to assure the reader of their capability,

The preface opens with the Greek word epeideper (KJV, “forasmuch as”; RSV, “inasmuch as”),
a classical word used only here in the NT but found in such major authors as Thucydides,
Philo, and Josephus.

○ When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where

shall we buy bread for these people to eat?" He asked this only to test him, for he already had
in mind what he was going to do.

● Luk 9:10

○ When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them

with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,

● Joh 1:44

○ Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.

Jesus’ exact words or his exact voice?

Interpreters distinguish between ipsissima verba (“the exact words”) and ipsissima vox (“the exact voice”
i.e., the presence of his teaching summarized). One can present history accurately whether one quotes or
summarizes teaching, or even mixes the two together. To have accurate summaries of Jesus’ teaching is
just as historical as to have his actual words; they are just two different perspectives to give us the same
thing. All that is required is that the summaries be trustworthy—a factor made likely not only by the
character of the writers and the nature of their religious convictions, but also by the presence of opponents
and eyewitnesses who one way or the other could challenge a fabricated report.

Case Study:
Did Mary go alone or were other women with her?

Matthew, Mark and Luke report that a small group of women went to the tomb. John focuses on Mary, and
she appears to speak for the others. In John 20:1 it is Mary who visits the tomb, but in the following verse
she announces to the disciples, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb and we do not know where
they laid him.” It is doubtful that this is a literary plural, since in verse 18 Mary returns from the tomb after
Jesus’ appearance to her and announces to the disciples, “I saw the Lord.”

Names used in the Gospels

●

The statistical distribution of names in the Gospels matches up with the statistical
distribution of names in 1st century Palestine.
This distribution is different after 70 AD.

●
● Why were the most popular names popular? Six of the nine most popular male names are
those of the Hasmonean family, Mattathias and his five sons (John, Simon, Judas, Eleazar,
and Jonathan), while the three most popular female names, Mary (Mariam), Salome, and
Shelamzion (the longer form of Salome), were also the names of members of the Hasmonean
ruling family.

● Since it was the Hasmoneans who won Jewish independence in the second century BC and

were the last Jewish rulers of an independent Jewish state, the popularity of their names into
the period of Roman rule was no doubt patriotic.

of his account.

Names used in the Gospels

●

That the relative frequency of the various personal names in the Gospels corresponds well to
the relative frequency in the full database of three thousand individual instances of names in
the Palestinian Jewish sources of the period. This correspondence is very unlikely to have
resulted from addition of names to the traditions, even within Palestinian Jewish Christianity,
and could not possibly have resulted from the addition of names to the traditions outside
Jewish Palestine, since the pattern of Jewish name usage in the Diaspora was very different.
The usages of the Gospels also correspond closely to the variety of ways in which persons
bearing the same very popular names could be distinguished in Palestinian Jewish usage.
Again these features of the New Testament data would be difficult to explain as the result of
random invention of names within Palestinian Jewish Christianity and impossible to explain
as the result of such invention outside Jewish Palestine. All the evidence indicates the
general authenticity of the personal names in the Gospels.

Names used in the Gospels

● While most beneficiaries of Jesus’ healings and resuscitation miracles are anonymous,

Jairus (whose daughter was raised) is named in Mark and Luke, Bartimaeus in Mark, Lazarus
in John. Since people who encounter Jesus on one occasion are usually not named, why
should the Pharisee who entertains Jesus to dinner in Luke 7 be named (Simon, 7:40)? Why
should Simon of Cyrene be named?

Jesus and the eyewitnesses: the Gospels as eyewitness testimony Richard Bauckham.

Names used in the Gospels

●

It is likely that many of these people were themselves the eyewitnesses who first told and
doubtless continued to tell the stories in which they appear and to which their names are
attached. A good example is Cleopas (Luke 24:18): the story does not require that he be
named and his companion remains anonymous. There seems no plausible reason for naming
him other than to indicate that he was the source of this tradition

Names used in the Gospels

● Anonymous Persons in Mark’s Passion Narrative

○ Cases where a person who is anonymous in Mark is named in another. For example,

John alone identifies the woman who anoints Jesus as Mary of Bethany, the man who
cut off the ear of the high priest’s slave as Peter, and the slave himself as Malchus.

● Anonymous Persons in Mark’s Passion Narrative
● Mark 14: 3-9

○

9 Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has
done will also be told, in memory of her."

● Protective Anonymity

○ When Mark was written this woman would have been in danger were she identified as
having been complicit in Jesus’ claim to messianic kingship. Her danger was perhaps
even greater than that of the man who attacked the servant of the high priest, for it was
she who had anointed Jesus as Messiah.

○ A number of scholars have seen this woman’s anointing of Jesus as the anointing

entailed by the term Messiah (Anointed One), comparable with the anointing of kings in
the Hebrew Bible.

Burden of Proof

Should we assume that the gospels are reliable unless they are proven to be
unreliable? Or should we assume that the gospels are unreliable unless they are
proven to be reliable? Are they innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven
innocent?

Burden of Proof

● Why should I think the skeptical assumption is wrong?

○

■
■

There was insufficient time for legendary influences to erase the core historical facts.
“How can you know anything that happened two thousand years ago?”
The crucial time gap is not the gap between the evidence and today; rather what’s
important is the gap between the evidence and the original events that the evidence is
about.

Burden of Proof

● Why should I think the skeptical assumption is wrong?

○

The gospels are not analogous to folk tales, myths, or contemporary “urban legends.”

■

These are not  like the gospel narratives, which are about real people who actually lived,
real events that actually occurred, and real places that actually existed.

■ You can read about people like Pontius Pilate, Joseph Caiaphas, and even John the

Baptist in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus?

Burden of Proof

● Why should I think the skeptical assumption is wrong?

○

The Jewish transmission of sacred traditions was highly developed and reliable.

■

■
■

In an oral culture like that of first-century Israel, the ability to memorize and retain large
tracts of oral tradition was a highly prized and highly developed skill. From the earliest
age children in the home, elementary school, and the synagogue were taught to
memorize faithfully sacred tradition.
The disciples would have exercised similar care with the teachings of Jesus.
To compare the Jewish transmission of traditions to the child’s game of “telephone” is a
gross misrepresentation.

The Resurrection Argument

● In defending the resurrection, we do not need to treat the New Testament as
inspired or inerrant, but simply as a collection of Greek documents coming
down to us out of the first century.

The Resurrection Argument

1. There are four established facts concerning the fate of Jesus of Nazareth: his
honorable burial by Joseph of Arimathea, the discovery of his empty tomb, his
post-mortem appearances, and the origin of his disciples' belief in the
resurrection.

2. The hypothesis "God raised Jesus from the dead" is the best explanation of

these facts.

3. The hypothesis "God raised Jesus from the dead" entails that God exists.
4. Therefore God exists

The Resurrection Argument

● Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3–5 quotes an old Christian tradition that he had
received from the earliest disciples. Paul probably received this tradition no
later than his visit to Jerusalem in AD 36 (Gal. 1:18), if not earlier in
Damascus. It therefore goes back to within the first five years after Jesus’
death in AD 30. The tradition is a summary of the early Christian preaching
and may have been used in Christian instruction.

○ Here’s what it says:

■ That Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures,
■ And that he was buried,
■ And that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the

scriptures,

■ And that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.

The Resurrection Argument

The Resurrection Argument

This remarkable correspondence of independent traditions is convincing proof that
Paul’s four-line formula is a summary or outline of the basic events of Jesus’
passion and resurrection, including His burial in the tomb. We thus have evidence
from some of the earliest, independent sources in the New Testament for the
burial of Jesus in the tomb

William Lane Craig

The Resurrection Argument

Straight to the Source

The gospel writers used sources for the life of Jesus, as they themselves tell us. Much of New Testament
studies is devoted to detecting those sources, for they will drive you back very close to the events
themselves, thereby reducing the probability of legend or alteration. Mark, for example, was likely one of
the sources used by Matthew and Luke. Mark evidently had a source for the passion story, since it stands
out in his gospel as a connected narrative. Matthew and Luke also had other sources than Mark; some
think they had a collection of Jesus’ sayings to which scholars have assigned the arbitrary name “Q.” By
contrast John is usually thought to be independent of the other three gospels. Paul says explicitly that in 1
Corinthians 15:3–5 he is handing on prior tradition about Jesus, a fact confirmed by the many non-Pauline
traits in the writing. Many scholars think that behind the sermons in Acts lie sources for early Christian
preaching that Luke used. These are just a few of the principal sources that lie behind the New Testament
documents.

William Lane Craig

The Resurrection Argument Fact 1

● Fact 1: After his crucifixion, Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea in a

tomb.

○ Highly significant because it means that the location of Jesus's tomb was known to Jew and

Christian alike in Jerusalem.

○ Evidence supporting this fact:

Jesus' burial is attested in the very old information 1 Corinthians 15:3–5.

1.
2. The burial account is part of very old source material used by Mark in his

gospel.

3. As a member of the Jewish high court that condemned Jesus, Joseph of

Arimathea is unlikely to be a Christian invention.

4. The burial story lacks any signs of legendary development.
5. No other competing burial story exists.

The Resurrection Argument Fact 1

For these and other reasons, most New Testament critics agree that Jesus was
buried by Joseph of Arimathea in a tomb. According to the late John A. T.
Robinson of Cambridge University, the burial of Jesus in the tomb is:

“one of the earliest and best-attested facts about Jesus.”

John A. T. Robinson, The Human Face of God (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1973), 131.

The Resurrection Argument Fact 1

In summary, the historical evidence is very strong that Jesus died by crucifixion.
The event is multiply attested by a number of ancient sources, some of which are
non-Christian and thus not biased toward a Christian interpretation of events. They
appear in multiple literary forms, being found in annals, historiography, biography,
letters, and tradition in the form of creeds, oral formulas, and hymns. Some of the
reports are very early and can reasonably be traced to the Jerusalem apostles.
The Passion Narratives appear credible, since they fulfill the criterion of
embarrassment and contain numerous plausible details. Finally, the probability of
surviving crucifixion was very low.

Licona, Michael R.. The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach
(p. 312). InterVarsity Press.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 2

A. Fact 2: On the Sunday after the crucifixion, Jesus' tomb was found empty by

a group of his women followers.

B. Evidence supporting this fact:

a. The old information I Cor 15 implies the empty tomb (e.g., "he was buried

... he was raised").

b. The empty tomb story is also part of Mark's very old source material.
c.
*The story is simple and lacks signs of legendary embellishment.
d. The fact that women's testimony was considered worthless at that time

counts in favor of the historicity of the women's discovering the empty
tomb.

e. The early Jewish allegation that the disciples had stolen the body

presupposes that the tomb was empty.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 2

f. The use of "the first day of the Week" (Mark 16:2) instead of "on the third

g.

day" points to the primitiveness of the tradition.
It would have been virtually impossible for the disciples to proclaim the
resurrection in Jerusalem had the tomb not been empty.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 2

Mark’s account of the empty tomb is remarkably simple and unembellished by
theological motifs likely to characterize a later legendary account. For example,
the resurrection itself is not witnessed or described, and there’s no reflection on
Jesus’ triumph over sin and death, no use of divine titles, no quotation of fulfilled
prophecy, no description of the risen Lord.

In contrast, the apocryphal Gospel of Peter, describes Jesus’ triumphant exit from
the tomb as a gigantic figure whose head reaches above the clouds, supported by
giant angels, followed by a talking cross, heralded by a voice from heaven, and all
witnessed by a Roman guard, the Jewish leaders, and a multitude of spectators!
This is how real legends look: They’re colored by theological and apologetical
developments. By contrast, Mark’s account is stark in its simplicity.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 2

The Gospel of Peter’s Account of the Resurrection

Early in the morning, as the Sabbath dawned, there came a large crowd from Jerusalem and the
surrounding areas to see the sealed tomb. But during the night before the Lord’s day dawned, as the
soldiers were keeping guard two by two in every watch, there came a great sound in the sky, and they
saw the heavens opened and two men descend shining with a great light, and they drew near to the tomb.
The stone which had been set on the door rolled away by itself and moved to one side, and the tomb was
opened and both of the young men went in.

Now when these soldiers saw that, they woke up the centurion and the elders (for they also were there
keeping watch). While they were yet telling them the things which they had seen, they saw three men
come out of the tomb, two of them sustaining the other one, and a cross following after them. The heads
of the two they saw had heads that reached up to heaven, but the head of him that was led by them went
beyond heaven. And they heard a voice out of the heavens saying, “Have you preached unto them that
sleep?” The answer that was heard from the cross was, “Yes!” (Gospel of Peter 9:1—10:5  AD 150–200)

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 3

A. Fact 3: On multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different
individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive
from the dead.

B. Evidence supporting this fact:

a. The list of eyewitnesses to Jesus' post resurrection appearances which is

quoted by Paul (1 Cor. 15:3-5) and vouched by his personal
acquaintance with the people involved guarantees that these
appearances occurred.

b. The appearance narratives in the gospels provide multiple, independent

attestation of the appearances.

c. The transformation of Paul and James.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 3

The appearance traditions in the gospels provide multiple, independent attestation of these appearances.
This is one of the most important marks of historicity. The appearance to Peter is independently attested
by Luke, and the appearance to the Twelve by Luke and John. We also have independent witness to
Galilean appearances in Mark, Matthew, and John, as well as to the women in Matthew and John.

Certain appearances have earmarks of historicity. For example, we have good evidence from the gospels
that neither James nor any of Jesus’ younger brothers believed in him during his lifetime. There is no
reason to think that the early church would generate fictitious stories concerning the unbelief of Jesus’
family had they been faithful followers all along. But it is indisputable that James and his brothers did
become active Christian believers following Jesus’ death.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 3

Even Gerd Lüdemann, the leading German critic of the resurrection, himself
admits,

“It may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples had
experiences after Jesus’ death in which Jesus appeared to them as the risen
Christ.”

Gerd Lüdemann, What Really Happened to Jesus?, trans. John Bowden
(Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 1995), 80.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 3

I reiterate that historians may conclude that subsequent to Jesus’ execution, a number of his followers had
experiences, in individual and group settings, that convinced them Jesus had risen from the dead and had
appeared to them in some manner. This conclusion is granted by a nearly unanimous consensus of
modern scholars and may therefore be added to our “historical bedrock.” Paula Fredriksen asserts that
“the disciples’ conviction that they had seen the Risen Christ . . . [is part of] historical bedrock, facts known
past doubting.” E. P. Sanders agrees: “That Jesus’ followers (and later Paul) had resurrection experiences
is, in my judgement, a fact.” Wedderburn writes, “It is an indubitable historical datum that sometime,
somehow the disciples came to believe that they had seen the risen Jesus.”

Licona, Michael R.. The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach (p. 372). InterVarsity
Press.

The Resurrection Argument - Fact 4

●

●

Fact 4: The original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that Jesus was risen from the
dead despite their having every predisposition to the contrary.
Imagine the situation the disciples faced following Jesus' crucifixion:

○

Their leader was dead. In addition, the Jews had no belief in a dying, much less rising,
Messiah

○ According to Jewish law, Jesus' execution as a criminal showed him a heretic, a man under

○

the Curse of God.
Jewish belief about the afterlife precluded anyone's rising from the dead before the general
resurrection at the end of the world.

● Nevertheless, the disciples suddenly came to believe so strongly that God had raised Jesus from

●

the dead that they were willing to die for the truth of that belief.
Luke Johnson: "Some sort of powerful, transformative experience is required to generate the sort of
movement earliest Christianity was."

● N.T. Wright: "That is why, as an historian, I cannot explain the rise of early Christianity unless Jesus

rose again, leaving an empty tomb behind him."

Refutation of the Swoon Theory

On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ

Refutation of the Conspiracy Theory

1.

It is a historical fact that no one, weak or strong, saint or sinner, Christian or heretic, ever
Confessed, freely or under pressure, bribe or even torture, that the story of the resurrection was a
fake, a lie, or a deliberate deception. Even when people broke under torture, denied Christ and
Worshipped Caesar, they never revealed that the resurrection was their Conspiracy. If they made up
the story, they were the most Creative, clever, intelligent fantasists in history, far surpassing
Shakespeare, or Dante or Tolkien. Fishermen's "fish stories" are never that elaborate, that so
convincing, that life changing, and that enduring.

2. Nothing proves sincerity like martyrdom. The disciples' character argues strongly against such a

3.

conspiracy on the part of all of them, with no dissenters.**
There could be no possible motive for such alie. Lies are always told for some selfish advantage.
What advantage did the "conspirators" derive from their "lie"? They were hated, scorned,
persecuted, excommunicated, imprisoned, tortured, exiled, crucified, boiled alive, roasted,
beheaded, disemboweled and fed to lions.

Refutation of the Conspiracy Theory

No one questions the sincerity of the Muslim terrorist who blows himself up in a public place or the
Buddhist monk who burns himself alive as a political protest. Extreme acts do not validate the truth of their
beliefs, but their willingness to die indicates that they are sincerely convinced of the truth of their beliefs.
Moreover, there is an important difference between the martyred apostles and those who die for their
beliefs today. Modern martyrs act solely out of their trust in beliefs passed along to them by others. The
apostles died for holding to their own testimony that they had personally seen the risen Jesus.
Contemporary martyrs die for what they believe to be true. The disciples of Jesus suffered and were
willing to die for what they knew to be either true or false.

Licona, Michael R.. The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach (p. 553). InterVarsity

Refutation of the Hallucination Theory

There were too many witnesses. Hallucinations are private, individual, subjective.

1.
2. Hallucinations usually last a few seconds or minutes; rarely hours. This one hung around for forty

days (Acts 1:3).

3. Hallucinations usually happen only once, except to the insane. This one returned many times, to

Ordinary people (Jn 20:19-21:14; Acts 1:3).

4. Hallucinations come from within, from what we already know, at least unconsciously. This one said
and did surprising and unexpected things (Acts 1:4, 9)-like a real person and unlike a dream.
The apostles Could not have believed in the "hallucination" if Jesus' corpse had still been in the
tomb. This is a very simple and telling point; for if it was a hallucination, where was the corpse?
They would have checked for it; if it was there, they could not have believed.

5.

Refutation of the Hallucination Theory

6.

If the apostles had hallucinated and then spread their hallucinogenic story, the Jews would have
stopped it by producing the body-unless the disciples had stolen it, in which case we are back with
the Conspiracy theory and all its difficulties.

7. A hallucination would explain only the post-resurrection appearances, it would not explain the empty

tomb, the rolled away stone, or the inability to produce the corpse. No theory can explain all these
data except a real resurrection.

Refutation of the Myth Theory

By far the most popular theory to explain away the resurrection, is to try to escape the traditional dilemma
of "deceivers" or "deceived" (hallucinators) by interpreting the Gospels as myth-neither literally true nor
literally false, but spiritually or symbolically true. This is the standard line of liberal theology departments in
colleges, universities and seminaries throughout the western world today.

1.

2.

The style of the Gospels is radically and clearly different from the style of all the myths. Any literary
scholar who knows and appreciates myths can verify this. There are no overblown, spectacular,
childishly exaggerated events. Nothing is arbitrary. Everything fits in. Everything is meaningful.
There was not enough time for myth to develop. The original demythologizers pinned their case onto
a late second century date for the writing of the gospels; several generations have to pass before
the added mythological elements can be mistakenly believed to be facts. Eyewitnesses would be
around before that to discredit the new, mythic versions.

It has great explanatory scope: it explains why the tomb was found empty, why the disciples saw
post-mortem appearances of Jesus, and why the Christian faith came into being.
It has great explanatory power: it explains why the body of Jesus was gone, why people
repeatedly saw Jesus alive despite his earlier public execution, and so forth.
It is plausible: given the historical context of Jesus’ own unparalleled life and claims, the
resurrection serves as divine confirmation of those radical claims.*
It is not ad hoc or contrived: it requires only one additional hypothesis: that God exists. And even
that needn’t be an additional hypothesis if one already believes that God exists.**
It is in accord with accepted beliefs. The hypothesis: “God raised Jesus from the dead” doesn’t in
any way conflict with the accepted belief that people don’t rise naturally from the dead. The Christian
accepts that belief as wholeheartedly as he accepts the hypothesis that God raised Jesus from the
dead.
It far outstrips any of its rival hypotheses. The conspiracy hypothesis, the apparent death
hypothesis, the hallucination hypothesis, and so forth. Such hypotheses have been almost
universally rejected by contemporary scholarship. None of these naturalistic hypotheses succeeds
in meeting the conditions as well as the resurrection hypothesis.

*Jesus’ Radical Self-Understanding

● What Did Jesus Claim?

○

Jesus’ parable of the wicked tenants of the vineyard (Mark 12:1–9)

■

It tells us that He thought of Himself as God’s only Son, distinct from all the prophets,
God’s final messenger, and even the heir of Israel itself!

○

Jesus explicitly claims to be God’s Son in Matthew 11:27 (compare Luke 10:22)

■

It tells us that He thought of Himself as the exclusive Son of God and the only revelation
of God the Father to mankind! Think of it! Jesus thought of Himself as God’s Son in an
absolute and unique sense and as having the exclusive authority to reveal His Father
God to men.

*Jesus’ Radical Self-Understanding

●

Jesus had a divine-human self-understanding.

○

The worship of Jesus by monotheistic Jews as God incarnate within twenty years of His
death requires an adequate cause to be found in Jesus’ own claims.

● Explicit claims

○ Messiah
■

The belief in the early church that Jesus was the Messiah requires an adequate
cause.

■ Peter’s confession (Mark 8:27–30)
■
■
■
■
■

Jesus’ answer to John the Baptist (Matt. 11:2-6; Luke 7:19–23)

The Resurrection Argument - Best Explanation

**The prominent then-atheist philosopher Antony Flew agreed:

“Certainly given some beliefs about God, the occurrence of the resurrection does become enormously
more likely.”

Row, 1987

Greg Koukl’s book Tactics

● Presents great techniques and tools to use in debate, argument, and just
casual conversation. Tactics includes using the Socratic method: asking
questions.

○ Questions get you into the driver’s seat and you can control a conversation.
○ Questions are diplomatic and non-combative.
○ Questions are neutral - your views aren’t even revealed.
○ Questions are conversation starters.

● Tactics are to be used to show a person their bad thinking not belittle them.
● Tactics give you a game plan and helps you maneuver better in a

conversation to maintain control.

The Columbo Tactic 1

● The Columbo tactic is named for Lieutenant Columbo of the long-running

television series Columbo, a brilliant detective who appears bumbling, inept,
and completely harmless.

○ With his rumpled trench coat, stub of a cigar, and borrowed pencil, Columbo looks like he

couldn’t think his way out of a wet paper bag.

○ While putting his foes at ease with his harmless demeanor, Columbo then employs his

trademark approach:

■

“I got a problem. Something about this thing bothers me. Maybe you can clear this up for
me. Do you mind if I ask you a question?”
“Thank you. You’re a very intelligent person. Oh, just one more thing.”
“I’m sorry. I’m making a pest of myself. It’s because I keep asking these questions. But I
can’t help it. It’s a habit.”
This is a habit you want to get into!

○

The Columbo Tactic 1

● “What do you mean by that?” (or some variation).

○

This is a clarification question that helps you learn what a person thinks so you don’t
misunderstand her or, worse, misrepresent her.

■
■

This question should be delivered in a mild, genuinely inquisitive fashion.
It also forces the person to be precise in their meaning, as many people object to
Christianity for reasons they haven’t completely thought through themselves.

The Columbo Tactic 1

● Use this question all day long and there is no pressure on you.

○ “All religions are basically the same.”

■  What do you mean by that? How are they the same?

○ “You shouldn’t force your views on me.”

■ What do you mean by that? Are you forcing your view on me?

○ “Everyone interprets the Bible differently and everyone’s is valid.”

■ What do you mean by that? Am I right and are you also right?

○ “There is no way that God can exists when there is so much evil in the world.”

■ What do you mean by that? What do you mean by evil? Where does it come

from?
○ “You’re intolerant.”

■ What do you mean by that?

Know the “Burden of Proof”

● “Burden of Proof”: A duty placed upon a civil or criminal defendant to prove or

disprove a disputed fact.*

● The burden of proof is the responsibility someone has to defend or give

evidence (or a argument not an assertion) for his or her view.

● The burden of proof has one cardinal rule: Whoever makes the claim bears
the burden. Don’t allow yourself to be thrust into a defensive position when
the other person is making the claim.

Difference between assertions and arguments.

● Someone may say: “I believe that abortion is wrong but I am not willing to

impose my belief on other people.”

● This is an assertion.

● Arguments are true premises that lead to a logical conclusion.
● Assertions are propositions regarding a belief or a state of affairs.
● The abortion statement is not an argument. There is no argument

presented for us to refute.

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● The burden of proof is the responsibility someone has to defend or give

evidence for his view, and the person who makes the claim bears that burden.

● It’s not enough to simply give an alternate explanation.
● The question used to reverse the burden of proof is, “How did you come to

that conclusion?” (or some variation).

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● The second Columbo question is, “Now, how did you come to that

conclusion?”

○

This question graciously assumes that the other person has actually reached a
conclusion—that he has reasons for his view and has not merely asserted it.
It will give him a chance to express his rationale, if he has one.
It will also give you more material to work with in addressing his concerns.
It ultimately shifts the burden of proof to the other person, which is where it belongs if
he’s making the claim.

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

Sometimes the simplest, most effective question you can ask someone is a
variation of the question:

● “How do you know?”
● “Why should I believe what you believe?”
● “What makes you think that’s the right way to see it?”
● “I’m curious. What makes you think that’s true?”

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● Consider these Columbo responses to the following claims.

○

“You can never know anything for sure.”—Why should I believe that? Can you give me a good
reason why I should think nothing can be known with confidence?
“Morals are just an invention of culture; there are no objective moral rules.”—What would be
your evidence for that?
“The miracles of Jesus in the Gospels were inventions of the early church.”—Can you give me
some of the reasons why you think that’s true?
“The resurrection of Christ is a myth added hundreds of years after Jesus lived.”—What
support do you have for that idea?
“The unborn may be human, but they’re not persons.”—What’s the difference between a
human and a person?

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● Reversing the burden-of-proof rule takes the pressure off you.

○ You don’t have to be the expert on every subject.
○ If you keep the burden on the other side when the other person is making

the claim, you don’t have to have all the answers.

○ In fact, you can be effective even when you know very little if you ask the

right questions.

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● A professor may claim “The Bible is just a bunch of fables”
● The “professor’s ploy” is simply his attempt to get you to shoulder the burden

of proof when he has made the claim.

○ When you ask your Columbo questions, he may assume you’re a Christian and call you out

saying, “You must be one of those Christians who thinks the Bible is the inspired Word of God.
Okay, since I’m a fair man I’ll give you a few minutes to prove that to the rest of the class. Go
ahead.”
In one quick move, he has cleverly placed the burden of proof on you, the student, even
though you didn’t make the claim.

○

○ Don’t take the bait!

■ You're not the one making the claim; he is.
■ He must defend his own view. He’s the teacher, after all.

The Columbo Tactic 2 - Reversing Burden of Proof

● Here’s how to respond to the “professor’s ploy.”

○ When he tries to shift the burden of proof on you, calmly say, “Professor, first, you don’t know
what I believe because I haven’t said anything about that. Second, my views don’t really
matter right now. You’re the teacher, and you’ve made a claim about the Bible. I’m just trying to
get clear on your meaning and also learn if you have any good reasons for it.”
If he gives an answer, thank him for it and either ask him another question or let it go.
