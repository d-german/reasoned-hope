# Understanding Arguments and Evidence

An argument isn't a quarrel. It's a set of statements (premises) that logically lead to a conclusion. We use the rules
of argumentation unconsciously in everyday life.

For example, if you tell a friend you're going to the library and they say you can't because it's Sunday and the library
is closed, they've just presented you with a logical argument.

## Deductive Arguments

In a deductive argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true. A good deductive argument is
considered **sound** if it is both logically valid and has true premises.

### Example: A Sound Argument

> 1. If today is Sunday, the library is closed.
> 2. Today is Sunday.
> 3. **Therefore, the library is closed.**

This is a logically **valid** argument. If premises (1) and (2) are true, the conclusion must also be true.

> **Another classic example:**
> 1. All men are mortal.
> 2. Socrates is a man.
> 3. **Therefore, Socrates is mortal.**

A good argument's premises should be more plausible than their denials. We don't need 100% certainty; if the premises
are more likely true than not, the conclusion is also more likely true than not.

### Examples of Flawed Arguments

An argument can be flawed if it is logically invalid, contains a fallacy, or is based on false premises.

#### 1. Invalid Logical Structure

An argument is invalid if the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, even if all statements are true.

> **Example:**
> 1. If Sherrie gets an A in Mathematics, she’ll be proud of her work.
> 2. Sherrie is proud of her work.
> 3. **Therefore, Sherrie got an A in Mathematics.**
>
> This is an invalid argument because Sherrie could be proud of her work for other reasons, like getting a B.

#### 2. Logical Fallacies

A fallacious argument uses faulty reasoning. A common example is a circular argument, which assumes what it is trying to
prove.

> **Example:**
> 1. If the Bible is God’s Word, then it is God’s Word.
> 2. The Bible is God’s Word.
> 3. **Therefore, the Bible is God’s Word.**
>
> While logically valid in its structure, this argument is fallacious because it proves nothing new.

common [logical fallacies](https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/).

#### 3. False Premises

An argument is unsound if it is based on one or more false premises, even if its logical structure is valid.

> **Example:**
> 1. Anything with webbed feet is a bird.
> 2. A platypus has webbed feet.
> 3. **Therefore, a platypus is a bird.**
>
> This argument is valid in its logic, but it is unsound because the first premise is false.

## Inductive Arguments

In an inductive argument, the premises provide strong evidence for the conclusion, making it probable but not
guaranteed.

> **Example:**
> 1. Groups A, B, and C contained similar people with the same disease.
> 2. Group A received a new drug, Group B received a placebo, and Group C received no treatment.
> 3. The death rate in Group A was 75% lower than in Groups B and C.
> 4. **Therefore, the new drug is likely effective in reducing the death rate.**

Other examples include drawing general conclusions from repeated observations, like concluding a bag contains only
pennies after repeatedly drawing a penny from it.

### Inference to the Best Explanation

This is a form of inductive reasoning where we select the hypothesis that best explains the available data from a pool
of possible options. The criteria for the "best" explanation include:

1. **Explanatory Scope:** Explains the widest range of data.
2. **Explanatory Power:** Makes the data more probable.
3. **Plausibility:** Aligns with other accepted truths.
4. **Less Ad Hoc:** Requires fewer new, unproven assumptions.
5. **Accord with Accepted Beliefs:** Conflicts with fewer accepted truths.
6. **Comparative Superiority:** Far exceeds rival hypotheses in meeting the above criteria.

> The debate between the Neo-Darwinian theory of evolution and Intelligent Design (ID) serves as a good example of
> applying inference to the best explanation. Proponents of ID might agree that the neo-Darwinian synthesis is the best
*naturalistic* explanation available. However, they argue that the crucial question is not whether it is the best
> naturalistic explanation, but whether it is the best *overall* explanation. Once Intelligent Design is allowed into the
> pool of live options, they contend, the superiority of the neo-Darwinian theory is no longer apparent.

## God and Evidence

    Q -->|"No!"| NT

    Soft_exp["It's possible for<br/>someone to know."]
    Hard_exp["It's impossible for<br/>anyone to know."]
    Soft --> Soft_exp
    Hard --> Hard_exp
```

When a non-theist says, "I don't believe in God," their reasoning often falls into one of these categories:

1. There isn't enough evidence.
2. I believe I can prove God doesn't exist.
3. I don't care to discuss it.

While it's easy to disprove concepts that are logically impossible (like a "square circle"), it is much harder to prove
the non-existence of God, as the concept is not inherently nonsensical.

### Is Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence?

When people say there's "not enough evidence" for God, they often mean there is no evidence that *forces* them to
believe. However, the absence of evidence is only evidence of absence if you would *expect* to see evidence if the thing
existed.

> **Analogy:** If an elephant were in a small room, you would expect to see it. So, not seeing it is good evidence it's
> not there. But if an ant were in the same room, you would not necessarily expect to see it, so not seeing it is not
> evidence of its absence.

So, the question becomes: If God existed, should we expect to have more evidence than we do? Not necessarily. The Bible
suggests God's primary goal is not merely to prove His existence but to draw us into a loving, voluntary relationship.
Overwhelming, coercive evidence could undermine this purpose (James 2:19).

### The Challenge of Atheistic Arguments

Many times, a refusal to believe is rooted in moral or personal reasons rather than purely intellectual ones. Sin and
self-centeredness can make it difficult to accept evidence, no matter how good it is.

Thoughtful atheists, however, do offer arguments against God's existence. The two most significant are:

* **The Problem of Divine Hiddenness:** Why doesn't God make His existence more obvious?
* **The Problem of Evil:** How can a good God allow so much suffering?

These two arguments represent the strongest intellectual challenges to theism and will be covered in detail.
