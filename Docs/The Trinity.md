The Trinity

Introduction

1. There's only one God
2. The Father is called God
3. The Son is called God
4. The Holy Spirit is called God
5. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are distinct persons.

 A person can be described as self-aware and aware of others who are also
self-aware, having an intellect, being volitional (having a will), and capable of
emotional thought and sensibilities or feelings.

Introduction

On the Christian view, God is not a single person, as traditionally conceived,
but is tripersonal. There are three persons, denominated the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, who deserve to be called God, and yet there is but one
God, not three. This startling rethinking of Jewish monotheism doubtless grew
out of reflection on the radical self-understanding of Jesus of Nazareth himself
and on the charismatic experience of the early church.

One What but three Who’s

Introduction

A consensus has emerged among New Testament critics that in his
teachings and actions—such as his assertion of personal authority, his
revising of the divinely given Mosaic law, his proclamation of the in-breaking
of God’s reign or kingdom into history in his person, his performing miracles
and exorcisms as signs of the advent of that kingdom, his messianic
pretensions to restore Israel, and his claim to forgive sins—Jesus enunciated
an implicit Christology, putting himself in God’s place.

Introduction

Indeed, in New Testament usage, God (ho theos) typically refers to God the
Father (e.g., Gal 4:4-6). Now this occasioned a problem for the New Testament
church: If God designates the Father, how can one affirm the deity of Christ
without identifying him as the Father? In response to this difficulty the New
Testament writers refer to Jesus principally as “Lord” (kyrios), the same word the
Septuagint translators used in place of God’s name Yahweh. The New Testament
writers applied to Jesus Old Testament proof texts concerning Yahweh (e.g., Rom
10:9, 13).

Introduction

This difference-in-sameness can lead to odd locutions like Paul’s confession “yet
for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we
exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom
we exist” (1 Cor 8:6).

Furthermore, the New Testament church, not content with the use of divine
nomenclature for Christ, also ascribed to him God’s role as the Creator and
Sustainer of all reality apart from God (Col 1:15-20; Heb 1:1-4; Jn 1:1-3).

Introduction

In places restraint is thrown to the winds, and Jesus is explicitly affirmed to be
(ho) theos (Jn 1:1, 18; 20:28; Rom 9:5; Titus 2:13; Heb 1:8-12; 1 Jn 5:20).
Noting that the oldest Christian sermon, the oldest account of a Christian
martyr, the oldest pagan report of the church, and the oldest liturgical prayer
(1 Cor 16:22) all refer to Christ as Lord and God, Jaroslav Pelikan, the great
historian of Christian thought, concludes, “Clearly it was the message of what
the church believed and taught that ‘God’ was an appropriate name for Jesus
Christ.”

Introduction

In short, the New Testament church was sure that only one God exists. But
they also believed that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, while personally
distinct, all deserve to be called God. The challenge facing the postapostolic
church was how to make sense of these affirmations. How could the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit each be God without there being either three Gods or
only one person?

New Testament -- Jesus is Lord

Did this title arise out of a Palestinian or Hellenistic milieu? In the Palestinian community “Lord”
was most commonly linked with Yahweh and became a regular circumlocution for the divine name
in public reading of the Scriptures. In the LXX it translates the Hebrew ʾădōnāy, a designation for
Yahweh. Furthermore, the use of marana tha (“our Lord, come” or “our Lord is coming”) in 1
Corinthians 16:22 suggests an early Palestinian origin. Therefore, calling Jesus “Lord” affirms his
oneness with God. Others, most notably Wilhelm Bousset and Rudolf Bultmann, tried to show that
the title arose from worship in Hellenistic Christian communities, which borrowed the title from
Greek background in which “Lord” commonly referred to the deity. They argued that the title, which
makes Jesus equal with God, could not have arisen in Palestinian monotheism, while Jesus was
first worshiped in these Hellenistic Christian communities. Though the debate is complex, the
former explanation has become preferable. Recognition by even Jesus’s enemies that he acted
and spoke with the authority of the OT Lord is not to be dismissed.

Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 3rd edition

New Testament -Jesus Authority

● The use of “I”.

○ “You have heard that it was said to the men of old ... but I say to you”

(Mat 5:21), Jesus annuls the statements of the past which were regarded
as having divine authority, setting his own “I” in the place where, in the
prophets, we find Yahweh’s.

○ In this, Jesus is not claiming, as the OT prophets and the rabbis did, to
be the legitimate interpreter of the law of God. He is instead setting
himself up over against the Torah.

○ Jesus is speaking as once the God of Moses did, and thus setting himself

and his words up directly alongside God and the word of God.

New Testament  -Jesus Authority

● The lack of messenger and word-event formulae.

○ Nowhere did Jesus follow the OT prophets in prefacing his words with the

messenger formula “thus says the Lord”; and, in the context of his
proclamation, the word-event formula “the word of God came to me” is
similarly lacking.
■ Compare Lu 3:2 “the word of God came to John”

○ The lack of messenger and word-event formulae in the case of Jesus is
an indication that Jesus’ proclamation cannot be understood simply in
prophetic categories.

New Testament -Jesus’ Authority

● Amen-formulae.
● “Amen, I say to you”

○ The Amen-formula normally served to strengthen someone else’s words,

and was used in OT times to adopt words of blessing or cursing.

○ Jesus used it without exception in order to preface and strengthen his

own words

○ The Amen-formula is an expression of Jesus’ divine certainty of himself

and the divine self-authentication of his own words.

New Testament -Jesus’ Authority

● The authority of Jesus’ words.

○ His use of the Amen-formula and “I” shows that Jesus intended his word

to take the place of the Torah. It was stated in contemporary Judaism that
the man who hears the words of the Torah and does good works is
building on firm ground. We find Jesus saying “he who hears these words
of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon
the rock”

○ None of the OT prophets says that ‘his words’ do not pass away or that it
is by his words that the fate of his hearers will be decided. But, this is
precisely what Jesus says”

New Testament -Jesus’ Claim to Forgive Sins

● Several of Jesus’ parables, which are acknowledged on all hands to have

been uttered by the historical Jesus, show that He assumed the prerogative to
forgive sins.

● In parables like the prodigal son, the lost sheep, and so forth, Jesus describes

persons who have wandered away from God and are lost in sin.

● But Jesus extended forgiveness to such persons and welcomed them back

into the fold.

● The problem is that no one but God had the authority to make such a

proclamation.
● Mark 2:1–12

New Testament -The Son of God

● Jesus’ parable of the wicked tenants of the vineyard. Mark 12:1–9
● In this parable, the vineyard symbolizes Israel (Isa. 5:1–7), the owner is God,
the tenants are the Jewish religious leaders, and the servants are prophets
sent by God. The tenants beat and reject the owner’s servants. Finally, the
owner decides that he has one left to send: his only, beloved son. “They will
respect my son,” he says. But instead, the tenants kill the son because he is
the heir to the vineyard.

● Even skeptical scholars recognize the authenticity of this parable.
● Now what does this parable tell us about Jesus’ self-understanding?
● It tells us that He thought of Himself as God’s only Son, distinct from all the

prophets, God’s final messenger, and even the heir of Israel itself!

New Testament -The Son of Man

● It’s very likely that Jesus claimed to be the Son of Man.

○ This was Jesus’ favorite self-description and is the title found most

frequently in the gospels (over eighty times). Yet remarkably, this title is
found only once outside the gospels in the rest of the New Testament
(Acts 7:56). That shows that the designation of Jesus as “the Son of
Man” was not a title that arose in later Christianity and was then written
back into the traditions about Jesus. On the basis of the criteria of
independent sources and of dissimilarity, we can say with confidence that
Jesus called Himself “the Son of Man.”

● Jesus was directing attention to the divine-human figure prophesied in Daniel

7:13–14

New Testament -The Son of Man

● In Daniel’s vision the figure looks like a human being (a son of man), but He

comes on the clouds of heaven, and to Him is given a dominion and glory that
belong properly to God alone.

Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer?
What is it that they testify against you?” But he was silent and did not answer. Again the
high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” Jesus said,
“I am; and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power, and
coming with the clouds of heaven.” Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why
do we still need witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy! What is your decision?” All
of them condemned him as deserving death. (Mark 14:60–64)

New Testament

Jesus had a divine-human self-understanding.

● Implicit claims

○ Jesus’ preaching of the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:28)
○ Jesus’ authority

■ The content and style of Jesus’ teaching (Matt. 5:31–32)
■ “Truly, I say to you” (Mark 8:12; 9:1; etc.)
■ Jesus’ role as an exorcist (Luke 11:20)
■ Jesus’ claim to forgive sins (Mark 2:1–12)
■ Jesus’ miracles (Matt. 11:4–5)
■ Jesus’ role as Judge (Luke 12:8–9)

New Testament

Jesus received worship as God and accepted it and is contrasted with others:

Act 10:25, 26  When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and
worshiped him. But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am just a man."

Also Acts 14:10-15

Rev 22:8,9 … And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the
angel who showed me these things. But he said to me, "Do not do that. I am a
fellow servant of yours and of your brethren … Worship God."

New Testament - Only Begotten

Only Begotten. Monogenēs occurs nine times in the NT, referring to Isaac (Heb.
11:17), the widow’s son (Luke 7:12), Jairus’s daughter (Luke 8:42), the demoniac
boy (Luke 9:38), and Jesus Christ (John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). In the
LXX it renders yāḥîd, meaning “only one” (e.g., Judg. 11:34).

The word’s second half is not derived from gennan (to beget), but is an adjectival
form derived from genos (origin, race, stock [think DNA]). Monogenēs, therefore,
could be rendered as “one of a kind.”

New Testament  John 5:18

John 5:17, 18  But He answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I
Myself am working."  For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more
to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling
God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.

● equal
○

Ἴσος isos: equal, in quantity or quality

● His own Father:

○ His privately owned, unique Father, a Father in a way in which no one else had Him for a

Father

1Jn_1:1-3). It was the Son of God who came in the likeness of men

So it shows two things: Christ is personally distinct from the father, and he is
literally equal to Him in every way. This is why Jesus can say, "anyone who
has seen me has seen the Father." Jn. 14:19

New Testament    John 1:18

John 1:18  No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the
bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.

The only begotten Son (KJV) … is the reading of the Textus Receptus. But
the best old Greek manuscripts (Aleph B C L) read monogenēs theos (God
only begotten) which is undoubtedly the true text. Probably some scribe
changed it to obviate the blunt statement of the deity of Christ and to make it
like John 3:16.

Robertson’s Word Pictures

New Testament    John 1:18

Whereas verse 1 asserts the deity of the Logos and affirms his
pretemporal relation to God, verse 18 posits the deity of the Son and his
intimate acquaintance with the Father as the basis of God's
self-disclosure, a basis that ensures the reliability, indeed the perfection,
of the divine revelation.

Murray Harris p 103

New Testament  John 20:28

John 20:28  Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"

My Lord and my God (Ho kurios mou kai ho theos mou). Not exclamation, but
address, the vocative case though the form of the nominative, a very common
thing in the Koiné. Thomas was wholly convinced and did not hesitate to
address the Risen Christ as Lord and God. And Jesus accepts the words and
praises Thomas for so doing.

Robertson’s Word Pictures

New Testament    John 1:1,18; 20:28

...as we shall see, within the Fourth Gospel as a whole, John 1:1c is the first

unequivocally affirm the essential divinity of Jesus Christ.

Rom 9:5  Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of

Lit “and of whom is the Christ according to the flesh, He being God over all”

A clear statement of the deity of Christ following the remark about his
humanity. This is the natural and the obvious way of punctuating the
sentence. To make a full stop after sarka [flesh] (or colon) and start a new
sentence for the doxology is very abrupt and awkward.

Robertson’s Word Pictures

New Testament Romans 9:5

When two (or more) nouns in the same case are linked by “the”, the repetition
of the article with the second noun shows unambiguously that the nouns are
separate items, while its non repetition indicates that the nouns are being
considered corporately, not separately, or that they have a single referent.

In the light of the foregoing evidence, it seems highly probable that In Titus
2:13 Jesus Christ is called "our great God and Savior," a verdict shared, with
varying degrees of assurance, by almost all grammarians and lexicographers,
many commentators, and many writers on NT theology or Christology,
although there are some dissenting voices.

New Testament Heb 1:8

Heb 1:8  But of the Son He says, "YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS FOREVER AND
EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.

Heb 1:9  "YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS;
THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF
GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR COMPANIONS."

This quotation is from Ps 45:7. It is not certain whether ho theos is here the
vocative or ho theos is nominative (subject or predicate) with estin (is)
understood: “God is thy throne” or “Thy throne is God.” Either makes good
sense.    Robertson’s Word Pictures

New Testament Heb 1:8

The application of ho theos; that was figurative and hyperbolic when applied
to a mortal king was applied to the immortal Son in a literal and true sense.
Jesus is not merely superior to the angels. Equally with the Father he shares
in the divine nature while remaining distinct from him. The author places
Jesus far above any angel with respect to nature and function, and on a par
with God with regard to nature but subordinate to God with regard to function.
There is an "essential" unity but a functional subordination. ..., it cannot be
deemed impossible for … it to be translated "O God," but this interpretation
seems improbable.

New Testament 2 Peter 1:1

2Pe 1:1  Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who
have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God
and Savior, Jesus Christ:

Lit “the God and Savior, Jesus Christ”

See previous discussion about only one definite article.

New Testament 2 Peter 1:1

The conclusion seems inescapable that in 2 Peter 1:1 the title God and
Saviour; is applied to Jesus Christ, a view endorsed by the great majority of
twentieth-century commentators with varying degrees of assurance, and by
most grammarians and authors of general works on Christology or 2 Peter.

New Testament 1 John 5:20

1Jn 5:20  And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us
understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is
true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

Grammatically “This” may refer to Jesus Christ or to “the True One.” It is a bit
tautological to refer it to God, but that is probably correct, God in Christ, at
any rate. God is eternal life John 5:26  and he gives it to us through Christ.

New Testament 1 John 5:20

Although it is certainly possible that “God”  refers back to Jesus Christ,
several converging lines of evidence point to "the true one," God the Father,
as the probable antecedent.

Anti-Trinity Text:  John 17:3

John 17:3  "This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

“What is said here of the only true God seems said in opposition to the gods whom
the heathens worshipped; not in opposition to Jesus Christ himself, who is called
the true God by John, in 1Jo 5:20.”

● Apply same logic to other verses:

Lord, Jesus Christ.

Since God alone created all things, how could Jesus have done it?

Anti-Trinity Text:  Mark 10:18

Mar 10:18  And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good
except God alone.

The young ruler was probably sincere and not using mere fulsome
compliment, but Jesus challenges him to define his attitude towards him as
was proper. Did he mean “good” (agathos) in the absolute sense as applied to
God? The language is not a disclaiming of deity on the part of Jesus.

Anti-Trinity Text:  Colossians 1:15-17 “first-born”

● The passage uses prototokos (first-born or first-bearer), rather than protoktistos

(first-created).

● OT Usage

○ The exclusive right of inheritance belongs to the firstborn. It is used
occasionally of superiority, see Ex 4:22; De 21:16, De 21:17, the
prohibition being against the evil of assigning the privileged position of
the "firstborn" to one born subsequently to the "first" child.

○ Ishmael, though Abraham’s eldest son, was not accounted firstborn

because his mother was a slave (Gen. 21:10).

○ Esau bartered his birthright and opened himself to the charge of
profanity, for he spurned his right of inheritance (Gen. 25:33).

Anti-Trinity Text:  Colossians 1:15-17 “first-born”

● OT Usage firstborn

○ Ephraim is called God's "firstborn son." Jeremiah 31:9, but Manasseh

was literally the firstborn. Genesis 41:51-52. Obviously, "firstborn" does
not always mean literally "first" born or "first" created.

○ Israel was God's "firstborn"; it enjoyed a privileged position and blessings

over all other nations (Ex 4:22; Jer 31:9).

○ The "first-born of death" is an idiom meaning a deadly disease (Job

8:13).

○ The "first-born of the poor" is and idiom meaning the poorest class of

people (Isa 14:30).

Anti-Trinity Text:  Colossians 1:15-17 firstborn

● NT Usage

○ Is used of Christ in His relationship to the Father, expressing His priority

to, and preeminence over, creation, not in the sense of being the "first" to
be born.

○ Think of prime minister.

■ Not a prime number but is the head of an elected government; the

principal minister of a sovereign or state.

○ Arians used these passages as evidence that our Lord was a

created being, but proper understanding is implied by the context in
Colossians, that it refers to the preincarnate Christ.

○ This is why in the New World Translation of Colossians 1:15-17, the
word "other" appears four times. There is no basis for this in either
the Greek text or in the rest of the translation.

Eternal Sonship or generation?

The summary argument of Arius: "The Father is a Father; the Son is a Son;
therefore the Father must have existed before the Son; therefore once the Son
was not; therefore he was made, like all creatures, of a substance that had not
previously existed."

"We cannot assent to these expressions, 'always Father, always Son;' 'at the same time Father and Son;' that 'the
Son always co-exists with the Father;' that 'the Father has no pre-existence before the Son, no, not so much as in
thought or a moment.' But this we think and teach, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor a part of the unbegotten by
any means. Nor is he made out of any pre-existent thing; but, by the will and pleasure of the Father, he existed
before time and ages, the only begotten God, unchangeable; and that before He was begotten, or made, or
designed, or founded, he was not. But we are persecuted because we say that the Son has a beginning, and that
God has no beginning. For this we are persecuted; and because we say the Son is out of nothing. Which we
therefore say, because he is not a part of God, or made out of any pre-existent thing" Arius ~320AD

Eternal Sonship or generation?

Eternal Generation. Deriving from Origen, this phrase denotes the intratrinitarian relationship between the Father
and the Son as taught by the Bible. “Generation” establishes that there is divine sonship prior to the incarnation
(cf. John 1:18; 1 John 4:9), there is thus distinction of persons within the one Godhead (John 5:26), and between
these persons there is order (cf. John 5:19; 8:28). “Eternal” reinforces the fact that the generation is not merely
economic (for human salvation as in the incarnation; cf. Luke 1:35) but essential; as such, it cannot be construed
in categories of natural or human generation. Thus it does not imply a time when the Son was not, as Arianism
argued. Nor is there expected a final absorption of the Son. Nor does the Son’s distinct personhood mean that he
is separate in essence. Nor does his subordination imply inferiority. In virtue and not in spite of the eternal
generation, the Father and the Son are one (John 10:30).

Objections have been lodged against the phrase as rhetorical, meaningless, and ultimately self-contradictory. Yet
it corresponds to what God has shown us of his own eternal being, and, if it carries an element of mystery (only to
be expected), it rightly finds creedal expression in “begotten of his Father before all worlds” (Nicene) and
“begotten before the worlds” (Athanasian).
