Imputation

● Imputation

○ A broad concept finding its theological center in the atonement. The Latin imputare

literally means “to reckon” or “to charge to one’s account,” an adequate rendering
of the Greek logizomai (noun). This forensic notion has partial roots in the
commercial and legal language of the Greco-Roman world; those who have
something imputed to them are accountable under the law (e.g., Philem. 18).
○ Imputation also has distinctively Hebraic roots (cf. ḥāšab, “to count for, reckon”),
being used, for example, in reference to the sacrificial system (Lev. 7:18; 17:4).

● Phm 1:18  But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to

my account; (ellogeō verb)

Imputation

● In the NT, Christians receive what Luther termed “alien righteousness” of God
as a “gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:15).
Just as God reckoned Abraham as righteous through Abraham’s belief alone
(Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3), so others are similarly blessed as the Lord does not
impute their iniquity to them (Ps. 32:1–2; Rom. 4:7–8). This divine judicial act
is based not on human merit but on God’s love (Rom. 5:6–8).

Imputation

● For what does the Scripture say? "ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS
CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS." Now to the one who works, his
wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does
not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as
righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom
God credits righteousness apart from works: "BLESSED ARE THOSE
WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS
HAVE BEEN COVERED. "BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD
WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT." Romans 4:1-8

Imputation Christ righteous has been imputed to us.

Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the
law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of
death. For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did:
sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He
condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the Law might be
fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

Romans 8:1-4

Imputation Christ righteous has been imputed to us.

What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He
who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not
also with Him freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God's
elect? God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus
is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who
also intercedes for us.

Romans 8:31-34

Imputation  Our sins were imputed to Christ

That our sins are imputed to Christ is not expressly stated in the Scripture, but is
implied in the Old Testament sacrificial system, which is typical of the sacrifice of
Christ. The imposition of hands on the head of the victim signified the substitution
of it for the offender and the transfer of his guilt to it. When, therefore, the Servant
of Yahweh in Isa_53:1-12 is said “to bear iniquity” (Isa_53:11), or that “the
chastisement of our peace was upon him” (Isa_53:5), or that “Yahweh hath laid
(literally, “caused to fall”) on him the iniquity of us all” (Isa_53:6), the idea
expressed is that Christ bore the punishment of our sin vicariously, its guilt having
been imputed to Him.

Imputation  Our sins were imputed to Christ

Gal 3:13  Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse
for us—for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"—

2Co 5:21  He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might
become the righteousness of God in Him.

1Pe 2:24  and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might
die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.

Justification

The biblical meaning of “justify” (Heb. ṣādēq; Gk. dikaioun [LXX and NT]) is to
pronounce, accept, and treat as just—that is, as, on one hand, not penally liable,
and, on the other, entitled to all the privileges due to those who have kept the law.
Justification thus settles the legal status of the person justified and can be
characterized as a forensic term (Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Rom. 8:33–34).

There is no lexical ground for the view that “justify” means, or connotes as part of
its meaning, “make righteous”

Justification is a legal act of imputing the righteousness of Christ to the believer
(Rom. 4:11, Phil. 3:9).

Justification

Paul’s deliberately paradoxical reference to God as “justifying the ungodly” (Rom.
4:5)—the same Greek phrase used in Exodus 23:7 and Isaiah 5:23 of the corrupt
judgment that God will not tolerate—reflects his awareness that this is a startling
doctrine.

It seems unthinkable that a God who thus reveals just and inflexible wrath against
all human ungodliness (Rom. 1:18) should justify the ungodly.

(Rom. 3:25–26). The statement is emphatic, for the point is crucial. Paul is saying
that the gospel, which proclaims God’s apparent violation of justice, is really a
revelation of divine justice.

Justification

God justifies sinners on a just ground, namely, that the claims of God’s law on
them have been fully satisfied. The law has not been altered, or suspended, or
flouted for their justification, but fulfilled—by Jesus Christ, acting in their name. By
perfectly serving God, Christ perfectly kept the law (cf. Matt. 3:15). His obedience
culminated in death (Phil. 2:8); he bore the penalty of the law in our place (Gal.
3:13) to make propitiation for sins (Rom. 3:25). On the ground of Christ’s
obedience, God imputes not sin but righteousness to sinners who believe (Rom.
4:2–8; 5:19).

Justification

For what does the Scripture say? "ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS
CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS." Now to the one who works, his wage is
not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but
believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, just
as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness
apart from works: "BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN
FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED. "BLESSED IS THE MAN
WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT."  (Rom 4:3-8)

Atonement Introduction

● The word atonement is a derivation of the phrase “at onement,” designating a
state of harmony. Its primary meaning is reconciliation, specifically between
God and man.

● The message of the New Testament is that God, out of his great love, has

provided the means of atonement through Christ. By his death on the cross
Christ has made possible the reconciliation of alienated and condemned
sinners to God (Jn 3:16).

● But how did Christ’s death on the cross overcome the estrangement and
condemnation of sinners before a holy God, so as to reconcile us to him?

Introduction

● A great variety of theories of the atonement have been offered over the

centuries: ransom theories, satisfaction theories, moral influence theories,
penal substitution theories, and so on.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

He was despised and rejected—a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief. We
turned our backs on him and looked the other way. He was despised, and we did not
care. Yet it was our weaknesses he carried; it was our sorrows that weighed him down.
And we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a punishment for his own
sins! But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we
could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. All of us, like sheep, have
strayed away. We have left God’s paths to follow our own. Yet the LORD laid on him
the sins of us all. He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He
was led like a lamb to the slaughter. And as a sheep is silent before the shearers, he
did not open his mouth. Unjustly condemned, he was led away. No one cared that he
died without descendants, that his life was cut short in midstream. But he was struck
down for the rebellion of my people.   Isaiah 53:3-8 NLT

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that
you should follow in his steps. "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his
mouth." When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he
made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. "He himself
bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for
righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed."

1 Peter 2:21-24

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no
difference between Jew and Gentile, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ
Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his
blood--to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in
his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished-- he did it to
demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who
justifies those who have faith in Jesus.

Romans 3:22-26

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Was Christ was punished for our sins?

● Penal substitution: God inflicted on Christ the suffering we deserved as the

punishment for our sins, as a result of which we no longer deserve
punishment.
○ Was Christ was punished for our sins?

■ No?

● Christ endured the suffering that would have been our

punishment had it been inflicted on us.

■ Yes?

● Christ was punished in our place and so bore the punishment

for our sins.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Definition of Punishment

○ Punishment involves harsh treatment.
○ Harsh treatment is not necessarily the same as punishment.

■ God may justifiably inflict suffering on some person without it being

punishment.

○ So what transforms harsh treatment into punishment? This is where the

debate begins.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

1. For an act to count as punishment, it must have four elements.

i.

It must impose some sort of cost or hardship on, or at the very least
withdraw a benefit that would otherwise be enjoyed by, the person being
punished.

ii. The punisher must do so intentionally, not as an accident, and not as a

side-effect of pursuing some other end.

iii. The hardship or loss must be imposed in response to what is believed to

be a wrongful act or omission.

iv. The hardship or loss must be imposed, at least in part, as a way of

sending a message of condemnation or censure for what is believed
to be a wrongful act or omission.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/justice-retributive

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/

This is a version of what is called an expressivist theory of punishment,
according to which the harsh treatment imposed must express “condemnation or
censure” in order to count as punishment.

Censure:

1. An expression of strong disapproval or harsh criticism.

2. An official rebuke, as by a legislature of one of its members.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Different from penalty?
● Penalties do not express condemnation or censure.
● We usually don't apply the term punishment to parking tickets, offside

penalties in sports, firings at work, flunkings in school, disqualifications from
competitions, contract violations and fines inflicted for violations of civil law
and so on.

● Penalties can be very harsh and often express society’s “resentment” and

“stern judgment of disapproval” for the wrong done.

● There are crimes that are punishable, that  do not seem to express censure.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION The Alleged Incoherence of Penal Substitution

Some critics of penal substitution have claimed that, it is conceptually impossible
that God punish Christ for our sins. For God could not condemn or censure Christ,
since he did no wrong. The point is not that it would be immoral for God to punish
Christ for others’ wrongs, but that any such harsh treatment inflicted on him by
God for those wrongs would not count as punishment because it would not
express censure.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● If one holds that God did not punish Christ, then this objection does not apply.

○ One is adopting a counterfactual characterization

■ “I trust that the reader will understand: I mean that the volunteer

undergoes something that would have constituted punishment if it
had happened instead to the guilty offender.”
● David Lewis, “Do We Believe in Penal Substitution?,”

Philosophical Papers 26, no. 3 (1997): 209.

● Penal substitution: God inflicted on Christ the suffering we

deserved as the punishment for our sins, as a result of which we no
longer deserve punishment.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● If one holds that God did punish Christ:

○ Reject the expressivist theory of punishment and adopt one according
to which punishment is harsh treatment of someone by a recognized
authority for an infraction of a law or command.

○ Borrow the distinction between punishment and penalty, say that God

penalized Christ for our sins.
■ If God’s harsh treatment of Christ did not express censure, then God
did not punish Christ for our sins, but he may still be said to have
penalized him for our sins.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● If one holds that God did punish Christ and the expressivist theory of

punishment:
○ The fourth condition allows censure to be of either the person who did the

act or of the act itself and this perfectly consistent with penal substitution.

○ It is not required that condemnation be directed toward the person

bearing the punishment.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● If one holds that God did punish Christ and the expressivist theory of

punishment and does require that censure be directed toward the person
punished.
○ Adopt a theory of penal substitution that includes the imputation of our

sins to Christ.

○ Christ, though personally without moral fault, is legally guilty and so

condemned by God for our sins.
■ Critics admit that given the doctrine of the imputation of sins, their
charge of incoherence fails; but they complain that we have no
experience of the transfer of moral responsibility for actions from one
person to another.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● If the doctrine of imputation is true, then do we need to have some

experience of such a transfer in human affairs?
○ No we don’t. Where is an argument for that?
○ Might we plausibly respond that imputation of sins or guilt is a uniquely

divine act? Arguably, only God as supreme Lawgiver, Judge, and Ruler is
in a position to impute the sins and guilt of one person to another.
○ Note that the question does not concern the transfer of guilt from one

person to another, in the sense that guilt is removed from one person and
placed on another.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● For the defender of the doctrine of imputation does not hold that when my
guilt is imputed to Christ, it is thereby removed from me. Guilt is merely
replicated in Christ.

● The entire rationale of penal substitution is, rather, the removal of guilt by

punishment. What is at issue, then, is whether we have any experience of the
replication of guilt in a person different from the person who did the act.

● We do!

○ In civil law there are cases involving what is called vicarious liability.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● Vicarious liability.
● In such cases the principle of respondeat superior (loosely, the master is

answerable) is invoked in order to impute the liability of a subordinate to his
superior, for example, a master’s being held liable for acts done by his
servant.
○ An employer, for example, may be held liable for acts done by his

employee in his role as employee, even though the employer did not do
these acts himself.

● In cases of vicarious liability, then, we have the responsibility for the act

imputed to another person than the actor.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Responses to Alleged Incoherence

● Interestingly, vicarious liability is another case of strict liability, where the
superior is held to be guilty without being found blameworthy, since no mens
rea is required. He is thus guilty and liable to punishment even though he is
not culpable.

● Thus the vicarious liability that exists in the law suffices to show that the

imputation of our guilt to Christ is not wholly without parallel in our experience.
In the law’s imputation of guilt to another person than the actor, we actually
have a very close analogy to the doctrine of the imputation of our guilt to
Christ.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION Justification of Punishment

● Theories of justice:

○ Retributive: punishment is justified because the guilty deserve to be

punished.
■ Retrospective, imposing punishment for crimes committed

○ Consequentialist: punishment is justified because of the extrinsic goods
that may be realized thereby, such as deterrence of crime, sequestration
of dangerous persons, and reformation of wrongdoers.
■ Prospective, imposing punishment to prevent crimes from being

committed.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ God’s punishing Christ in our place would be an injustice on God’s part.

For it is an axiom of retributive justice that it is unjust to punish an
innocent person. But Christ was an innocent person. Since God is
perfectly just, he cannot therefore have punished Christ.

○ It does no good to say that Christ willingly undertook this self-sacrifice on
our behalf, for the nobility of his selfless act does not annul the injustice
of punishing an innocent person for deeds he did not do.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● One quick and easy way to deal with this objection would be to adopt a

consequentialist theory of justice. On consequentialist theories of justice
punishment of the innocent may be justified.
○ A consequentialist penal theorist could fairly easily provide justification
for God’s punishing Christ for our sins, namely, so doing prevents the
loss of the entire human race.

○ But the biblical view is that the wicked deserve punishment (Rom 1:32;

Heb 10:29), so that retributive justice must be at least part of the
justification of divine punishment.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ Even if God has established a system of justice among human beings

that forbids the punishment of the innocent, he himself is not so
forbidden. If He wills to take on human nature in the form of Jesus of
Nazareth and give his own life as a sacrificial offering for sin, who is to
forbid him?
■ He is free to do so as long as it is consistent with his nature.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ The objectors to penal substitution have not sufficiently differentiated

various types of retributive justice.
■ Negative retributivism holds that the innocent should not be

punished because they do not deserve it.

■ Positive retributivism holds that the guilty should be punished

because they deserve it.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ God is a positive retributivist “who will by no means clear the guilty” (Ex

34:7 RSV).

○ But the penal theorist may maintain that God is only qualifiedly a negative
retributivist, since even if he has prohibited human beings from punishing
innocent persons (Deut 24:16), and even if he is too good to himself
punish innocent human persons, still he reserves the prerogative to
punish an innocent divine person, namely Christ, in the place of the
guilty.

○ But, even if God’s justice includes unqualified negative retributivism,

there can be overriding considerations in the case of Christ.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ “For an act to have an unjust quality (whatever its effects) it must be,
objectively speaking, the wrong thing to do in the circumstances,
unexcused and unjustified, voluntarily undertaken, and deliberately
chosen by an unrushed actor who is well aware of the alternatives open
to him.” Joel Feinberg and Hyman Gross, eds., Philosophy of Law, 2nd ed., (Belmont, CA:
Wadsworth, 1980), p. 286.

○ In the case of the death of Christ the penal theorist claims that God did
the “right” thing (i.e., acted in accord with the right) in allowing Christ to
be unjustly treated for the sake of the salvation of mankind.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ “It is the unjust punishment of the Servant in Isaiah 53 that is so

remarkable. Forgiveness, restoration, salvation, reconciliation—all are
possible, not because sins have somehow been canceled as if they
never were, but because another bore them unjustly. But by this adverb
‘unjustly’ I mean that the person who bore them was just and did not
deserve the punishment, not that some moral ‘system’ that God was
administering was thereby distorted.” D. A. Carson, “Atonement in Romans
3:21-26,” in The Glory of the Atonement: Biblical, Historical, and Practical Perspectives, ed.
Charles E. Hill and Frank A. James III (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2004), 133.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ So in the extreme case where one must punish an innocent person or
else the world will be totally destroyed, one should punish the person.
God by punishing Christ for our sins has saved the world from total
destruction and was therefore acting compatibly with moral goodness.

PENAL SUBSTITUTION

● Responses to the Alleged Injustice of Penal Substitution

○ But was Christ indeed innocent?
○ No if you affirm the imputation of our sins to Christ.
○ For Christ in virtue of the imputation of our sins to him was legally guilty
before God. Therefore, he was legally liable to punishment. Thus, given
the doctrine of the imputation of sins, the present objection to penal
substitutionary theories is a nonstarter, being based on a false
assumption.
