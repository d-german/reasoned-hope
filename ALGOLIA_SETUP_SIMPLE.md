# 🔍 Simple Algolia Search Fix

## 🚨 **The Real Issue**

Your Algolia search wasn't working because:

1. **Missing Algolia artifact collection** - The build wasn't saving the Algolia indexes that Writerside automatically generates
2. **Missing publisher job** - No step to actually upload the indexes to Algolia
3. **Wrong secret name** - Using `ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY` instead of `ALGOLIA_KEY`

## ✅ **Simple Fix Applied**

I've updated your workflow to match the working project pattern:

### **What Changed:**
1. ✅ **Added Algolia artifact collection** in the build step
2. ✅ **Added official Algolia publisher job** using JetBrains' Docker container
3. ✅ **Fixed environment variables** to match Writerside's expectations
4. ✅ **Simplified deployment** by removing custom indexing script

### **Key Insight:**
**Writerside automatically generates Algolia indexes during build** - we just need to collect and publish them using JetBrains' official tools.

## 🔧 **Required Action**

You need to update your GitHub repository secret:

### **Current Secret (Wrong):**
- Name: `ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY`
- Value: Your Algolia write API key

### **Required Secret (Correct):**
- Name: `ALGOLIA_KEY` 
- Value: Your Algolia write API key (same value, different name)

### **How to Update:**
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/d-german/reasoned-hope`
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Either:
   - **Rename** `ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY` to `ALGOLIA_KEY`, OR
   - **Add new secret** named `ALGOLIA_KEY` with your write API key value

## 🧪 **Testing**

After updating the secret:

1. **Commit and push** these workflow changes
2. **Monitor GitHub Actions** - you should see a new `publish-indexes` job
3. **Check the logs** for successful indexing messages
4. **Test search** on your deployed site

## 🎯 **Expected Workflow**

The updated workflow now follows this pattern:
1. **Build** → Generates both web files AND Algolia indexes
2. **Test** → Validates the documentation
3. **Deploy** → Publishes to GitHub Pages
4. **Publish-indexes** → Uploads Algolia indexes using JetBrains' official publisher

This is the **official Writerside approach** and much more reliable than custom scripts!

## ✅ **Verification**

After the workflow runs, you should see:
- ✅ All 4 jobs complete successfully
- ✅ Search results appear when testing your site
- ✅ New content gets indexed automatically on future updates

The search functionality should now work correctly using Writerside's built-in Algolia integration!
